mr. thomas clydesdale took the oath of allegiance .
his excellency the president : i should like to welcome all new members to this council .
his excellency the president : honourable members , since our last meeting , sir roger lobo , dr. harry fang , mr. francis tien , mr. alex wu , mr. wong lam , mr. andrew so , mr. bill brown , mr. keith lam and mr. carl tong have retired from this council .
happily they are present in the chamber today to receive the warm tributes due to them all for their notable contribution to the work of this council .
sir roger lobo joined the council over 13 years ago .
for the last four years , perhaps the most significant four years in the council &apos;s history , he has been the senior among the appointed members .
the skill and tact with which he has guided his colleagues has been matched only by his consistent concern for the people of hong kong .
the quiet warmth of his personality and his selfless dedication to public service will be greatly missed .
dr. harry fang has served the council for 11 years , and has been a source of wise counsel in the important areas of medicine and social welfare .
he will be remembered above all for his outstanding contribution in the field of rehabilitation and in promoting the welfare of the disabled .
like dr. fang , mr. francis tien first joined this council in 1974 .
his staunch advocacy of free trade and the spirit of enterprise which are the life blood of hong kong &apos;s economy are reflected in the success story of hong kong &apos;s industry and trade .
honourable members will also miss the literary allusions which have enlivened his speeches .
the establishment of the academy for performing arts under his leadership , and his able advocacy in promoting the chinese language will be his monument .
mr. wong lam is another proponent of the chinese language who has done much to promote its use in the council .
as a member for nine years he can reflect with justifiable pride on his many achievements on behalf of the working people of hong kong , and on his quiet but determined guardianship of their interests .
mr. andrew so &apos;s wide range of interests and of public appointments has provided him with a depth of knowledge and breadth of vision which have been invaluable during his seven years in the council .
members will recall , too , the many occasions on which his wit and allegory have enriched our debates .
mr. w.c.l. brown &apos;s public appointments are numerous and exacting , even by the standards of his colleagues .
his financial background has been of particular value .
the amount of time he has given in his five years as a member is well matched by his analytical and commonsensical approach , and his steadfast advancement of the interests of hong kong , both inside and outside this council .
mr. keith lam and mr. carl tong belong to the latest generation of community leaders on the district boards .
in their short time on the council , they showed themselves to be keenly interested in the welfare of the community .
they will , i trust , continue their public service in other spheres .
these nine retiring unofficial members have between them contributed 68 years of service , with a range and depth of experience which by any standards is remarkable .
my valedictory remarks cannot do them full justice , but their names will be recorded in the history of this council during the period when hong kong &apos;s destiny was being shaped .
hong kong owes them much .
valedictions are not normally accorded to official members leaving the council , unless they are also retiring from public office .
however , six members are leaving this council not as part of the normal pattern but because of our constitutional reforms which have substantially reduced the number of official places .
these are the secretary for security , the secretary for economic services , the secretary for administrative services and information , the director of education , the commissioner for labour and the director of medical and health services .
they and their predecessors have contributed greatly to the work of the council .
our warmest thanks are due to them too for what they have done .
they will continue as public servants to play a highly valued role in our society .
i am able to say that all the unofficial members wish to be associated with your excellency &apos;s tribute to the retiring members .
more members have left us today and more members have joined us today than ever before in the history of this council .
yet it is continuity above all that the people of hong kong expect from us . the process of transformation of this council from its former pattern has led to the departure of six official members .
they have responded vigorously to our questions in our debates and we shall miss them .
among the unofficial members i should like to start by referring to the two elected district board members appointed a year ago .
mr. keith lam and mr. carl tong came to this council before district boards elected their representatives .
but they have served their boards well during the past year . mr. tong &apos;s familiarity with the central and western areas of hong kong and his knowledge of the business world lent a reality to his proposals .
mr. lam , whose family has for so long been associated with the southern part of hong kong island , presented the views of this fast developing area with vigour .
retiring members who have served for five to ten years are mr. bill brown who came to the council in 1980 , mr. andrew so , who was appointed in 1978 , and mr. wong lam who has served since 1976 .
it would be difficult to find three men with less in common in their backgrounds yet what excellent members of the team they made .
mr. brown as the head of the standard chartered bank made outstanding contributions to debates on financial and economic affairs .
but what is less well known is the care with which he has discharged his duties in the investigation of complaints . the redress system has had no more conscientious supporter .
mr. andrew so must go down as the aesop in our midst . as a teller of fables he has no rival .
mr. wong lam brought a refreshing frankness to matters that he discussed .
if buses can be said to have grass roots mr. wong lam grew straight out of them .
he would draw on his familiarity with the rough and tumble of life in the back streets to bring up sharply anyone who trotted out myths based on second hand reports .
one of mr. wong &apos;s lesser known contributions to the well-being of the council was the way he could charm our cares away by singing snatches of cantonese opera on our less serious social occasions .
mr. alex wu , mr. francis tien , dr. harry fang and sir roger lobo have all worked on this council for ten years or more . they are the four longest serving members .
they have given us all so much help in the past .
i feel i can now dare to call them the grand old men of the council .
theirs is the wisdom that comes from sheer length of service . they will take with them a fund of experience that will take us a long time to replace .
mr. alex wu , in this city of great material wealth , has never ceased to remind us that , as he said in this council , &apos; art is not divorced from life ... it is the expression of our attitude towards our lives ... . &apos;
mr. wu continues as chairman of the council for performing arts but i hope that we shall see a new spokesman for the arts in this council .
in the house of commons they identify the oldest member and call him the father of the house . it is surprising , when chinese people give such great respect to age , that we do not have the same custom here .
mr. francis tien was the father of the council for many years and is twice the age of the youngest member on his retirement .
this may come as a surprise to those who have seen him urging the vocational training council to new heights or battling for the cause of free trade . he has been known for years as &apos; mr. pants &apos; in the textile trade .
he is the prototype of the shanghai man whose industry carried hong kong from the poverty of the fifties to the prosperity of the seventies .
if we seek a new voice for the arts , so too we seek a new voice for the disabled on the departure of dr. harry fang .
dr. fang &apos;s devotion to the cause of rehabilitation both inside and outside the council has revolutionised our whole attitude as we begin to bring the disabled into the society of the ablebodied .
there is still a long way to go but what a difference there is between attitudes today and those when dr. fang joined the council more than ten years ago .
vigour and determination are the characteristics of this man . he not only cares about the problems of the disabled , but he knows exactly what requires to be done .
finally , sir , i am very glad to have the chance to pay a tribute to my predecessor as senior unofficial member , sir roger lobo .
sir roger has been on the council longer than any of the other retiring members , having joined in 1972 .
he has led the council since 1981 .
there are few years of hong kong &apos;s history that are not eventful .
but his period , seeing , as it did , the collapse of the land market , the disappearance of budget surpluses , and the negotiations on the future of hong kong must go down as one of the most difficult .
it was during the negotiations that sir roger &apos;s leadership came to prominence .
the negotiations were secret yet every move was known to executive council .
nothing could be said yet the strength of feeling on the issues at stake had to be assessed .
and these issues affected the whole livelihood of hong kong .
this was a harrowing time for anyone on executive council but for the leader of the legislative council , which was not privy to the talks , it must have been particularly delicate .
although hong kong itself had no status in the talks , and there was nothing this council could do constitutionally about either the talks or the outcome , sir roger moved the famous &apos; lobo motion &apos; expressing the view that &apos; this council deems it essential that any proposals for the future of hong kong should be debated in this council before any final agreement is reached &apos; .
in that debate , and in those that followed it , i believe this council gave voice to the real feelings and wishes of the people of hong kong .
the negotiations thrust greatness on sir roger who rose splendidly to the occasion .
but even before that he had made a place for himself among those in , to use a phrase he coined , the sandwich society .
the pedant may wonder just what the sandwich society is but we all know the felling of being pressed on all sides .
his plea for care not to ask for too much struck a strong chord of sympathy .
so too did his very human call to avoid proposals which created &apos; too wide a gap between what is statistically satisfactory and what is personally satisfying &apos; .
the council will miss his personal touch and characteristic cheerfulness .
sir , all these men have served hong kong well in this council .
the contribution of individuals to consensus cannot be measured but without the contributions of individuals there can be no consensus .
there have been many occasions when differences of view among us at the outset have given way through patient discussion to yield consensus .
this may not be as exciting as the fireworks of fierce debate and confrontational voting , but it is surely a better way to run a government .
suspended accordingly at fifteen minutes past five o &apos;clock .
( 1 ) introduction
honourable members of the legislative council , it is an honour for me to preside over this , the first meeting of the legislative council in its new chamber .
not only has the membership of the council been substantially enlarged but , for the first time in hong kong &apos;s history , an important part of its membership has been chosen by indirect election .
the opening of the 1985 / 86 session of the council thus marks another step in the evolution of representative government in hong kong .
2 . this evolution has been in progress for some time .
the urban council has had elected members for many years . in 1983 , the number of elected members was increased to 15 , the franchise was greatly extended , and members were elected for the first time from district constituencies .
district boards first had a proportion of their membership elected in 1982 ; the number of elected district board members was substantially increased earlier this year .
elections for the new regional council will be held in march next year .
throughout this process , the government has looked for progress combined with stability . it will continue to do so .
in this fast developing world , all societies are subject to change ; and their institutions must adapt to meet the changing requirements of the societies which established them .
at the same time , full weight must be given to the need for stability .
hong kong is successful economically and socially because it is a stable society .
progress and stability must go hand in hand .
3 . as regards the functioning of the council , i am confident that honourable members , whether elected by electoral colleges or by functional constituencies , whether appointed or official , will recognise that , when in this chamber , we are all part of one council .
each member may have his or her individual allegiance , but all of us have a common responsibility to the community as a whole .
the policies we endorse and the legislation we shall pass will affect the daily lives , not only of those sectors of the community which individual members may represent , but of everyone in hong kong .
while i expect issues to be vigorously debated in this chamber , it will be incumbent on us all never to lose sight of that common responsibility . 4 .
this new council will soon no doubt adopt its own distinctive working style .
in doing so , it inherits a successful pattern on which to build .
over the years , council members have built up a remarkable record as spokesmen for the community on vital issues .
they have scrutinised and passed an impressive body of law , which has provided the framework within which hong kong has been able to grow into the successful society it is today .
that society has evolved as a result of a constant consultative process between the government , the legislature and the community .
this consultative process has been a cardinal element in hong kong &apos;s success . the government firmly intends that it should be continued and strengthened .
5 . we shall need to monitor the functioning of our new arrangements over the next 18 months , before we take stock again in the 1987 review .
the reforms of 1985 are based on institutions which have served hong kong well ; they preserve the best features of these institutions .
it is important that hong kong should build a government structure at the central level which is appropriate to its own needs and in harmony with its own traditions .
the 1987 review will need to address a number of issues : whether there should be further changes in the composition of the council ; whether there should be direct elections ; what should be the relationship between the executive and legislative councils ; and other matters .
i have no doubt that , even before the review , there will be much public discussion on these subjects .
6 . before turning to other topics , i wish to say a few words about the structure and machinery of government in the territory as a whole .
( a ) structure 7 . 1985 has seen major progress in the district boards .
at elections on 7 march , the number of board members directly elected was increased from 132 to 237 ; in addition , 132 members have been appointed from a wide cross-section of the community . this composition enhances the representative nature of the boards and ensures continuity of proven experience .
the reconstituted boards have demonstrated their effectiveness in improving the environment of their districts , and in reflecting the views of local residents on local issues .
8 . the provisional regional council , constituted on 1 april this year to prepare for the establishment of the full regional council on 1 april 1986 , has set about its task with vigour .
like its urban counterpart , the new council will be financially autonomous and will derive most of its revenue from the rates .
it will be responsible for all aspects of environmental health , recreation and culture , outside the main urban area .
i am confident that the regional council will achieve the same success as the long-established urban council in carrying out this important work . 9 .
many of the members of the regional council , as of the urban council , will be directly elected .
the area which the regional council will serve comprises geographically separate communities ranging from major new towns to the older market towns , villages and islands .
in recognition of this fact , the council will have nine members elected by district boards and three ex-officio members from the heung yee kuk .
this membership will enable the regional council to formulate policies which give due weight to the needs and interests of the area as a whole , and of its component parts .
10 . at the apex of the three levels of government is the legislative council in its new format .
in constructing this framework , we have taken great care to establish close links between the three levels .
urban council members sit on the urban district boards .
there will be regional district board members on the regional council .
members of district boards and of both second level councils sit in this chamber . to complete the pattern , there are representatives here of all the major functional organisations and sectors of our society .
the system as a whole is thus both representative and closely knit .
( i ) complaints and the redress of grievances 11 . any just society should provide for those who seek the redress of grievances , or who wish to complain about the actions of government. departments and agencies .
hong kong has a very wide range of institutions and procedures for this purpose . immediate avenues open to the aggrieved citizen include district offices , district board members , the ward offices of members of the urban and regional councils , the independent commission against corruption , and the office of unofficial members of the executive and legislative councils .
12 . in view of the new composition of the legislative council and the development of more representative government , the efficacy of existing avenues of redress has been under review by unofficial members of the executive and legislative councils and by the government .
more work remains to be done ; but by the end of this year , a consultative document should be ready for publication .
it will outline the present situation , and set out options for building on present systems .
it will include the possibility of some sort of institution to enquire , on an independent basis , into complaints alleging maladministration by government departments .
the government intends wide public consultation on any possible changes , so that the views of the community , both on the principles and the details of any proposals , can be fully taken into account . if there is general support for change , draft legislation should be ready for submission to this council before the end of this session .
13 . i make on this subject one final , important point : unofficial members of the executive and legislative councils have for many years given much time and effort to dealing with complaints by the public , ranging from high policy to the smallest of matters affecting the livelihood or interests of an individual .
the large number of people who have made representations to them over the years provides proof of public confidence in them .
that function is crucial . it will continue , unimpaired by the introduction of any new institution .
if such an institution is created , it is likely to be a supplement to existing channels for the redress of grievances , rather than a replacement .
( ii ) chinese version of the statute law of hong kong 14 . all major decisions in our system of government are taken within , or are incorporated into , our statutes and ordinances .
it is right that laws should be available in the language of the majority of the population .
the executive council , in july this year , decided that an authentic chinese version of the statute law of hong kong should be produced . following that decision , the selection and training of staff have begun , and it is hoped that the first piece of new legislation in both languages will be produced in the 1986-87 session .
it is also the government &apos;s intention to make a start , in due course , on producing an authentic chinese version of the existing statute law .
( 3 ) economic and financial situation 15 . i shall speak now briefly on the economic and financial situation .
( a ) state of the economy and prospects 16 . as is the case in many parts of the world , the growth of our economy so far this year has been slower than expected . nevertheless , a growth rate of 4.5 per cent to 5 per cent for gross domestic product in 1985 is likely . even though this is lower than we had hoped , it is still satisfactory .
while domestic exports to the traditional markets have declined , exports to china have continued to record substantial growth . china has become the second largest market for our domestic exports .
re-exports have shown strong growth .
as a result , total exports for 1985 are expected to grow by 11 per cent .
17 . the property market has shown signs of revival . this reflects the return of confidence in hong kong and the fact that rentals and prices are now at more realistic levels .
18 . unemployment and underemployment figures have remained stable . in the three months june to august , the unemployment rate was 3.3 per cent and the underemployment rate was 1.4 per cent , indicating that the labour force is effectively fully employed . 19 .
the rate of inflation has remained relatively low , at about 3.8 per cent during the 12 months to september this year .
this has been due in part to moderate rates of inflation in those countries which are our major trading partners , to the easing of world commodity prices , and to the relative strength of the hong kong dollar .
there have been occasions when the link with the u.s. dollar has come under pressure , but the system has held up well . there are no plans to change it .
20 . looking ahead to 1986 , our economy remains dependent on trade and hence vulnerable to external forces outside hong kong &apos;s control .
consumer demand in our export markets and the willingness of other governments to allow consumers freedom of choice are clearly important factors .
the most immediate threat to the performance of our economy lies in calls for further protectionist measures , in particular in the united states .
( b ) management of the public finances 21 . as regards the public finances , a revival of activity in the property market has brought better than expected results from land sales .
these , together with improved yields from earnings and profits tax , should result in total revenue for the year being higher than originally estimated .
expenditure on general revenue account is also likely to be higher than estimated , as a result of $ 1.5 billion being injected as additional equity into the mass transit railway corporation .
the net effect at the end of the year will be a smaller deficit than was originally forecast .
the return to a balanced budget is now a realistic expectation .
22 . expenditure on capital works has been slower than originally forecast .
as a result , the size of the public sector as a proportion of gross domestic product should decline to below 16 per cent in the financial year 1985-86 .
23 . both the government and the business community remain in full agreement on the need for a simple and equitable taxation system .
the levels are set carefully so as to provide for hong kong &apos;s essential fiscal needs , but without acting as a disincentive to enterprise .
we shall not depart from that policy , which is important to the economic health of hong kong .
there are , however , loopholes in our system which those with access to sophisticated financial devices can exploit . they are thus able , within the law , to avoid paying the taxes which they were meant to pay ; and the burden of that unpaid tax then falls on others .
24 . proposed amendments to the inland revenue ordinance , designed to close the most readily exploitable of the loopholes , have recently been examined by the ad hoc panel of unofficial members of the executive and legislative councils .
the group has consulted widely with the professions and with the public . i am confident , as a result , that well- considered proposals will be introduced into the legislative council during this session . ( c ) regulation of financial and commercial sectors 25 . an important task for the government is to maintain confidence both internationally and locally in hong kong as a financial centre .
this requires that we should seek to improve the legal and institutional framework in which the financial and allied services industries operate .
there have been a number of recent developments in this field .
26 . a review of our system of supervisory control over banking operations is nearing completion .
there has been wide consultation with the financial community , and proposals for improvement will be put to the executive council as soon as possible .
27 . events of recent years , both here and in other major financial centres , indicate that the mere logging of technical compliance with statutory requirements is not enough to ensure that financial institutions are prudently managed .
no system of prudential supervision can prevent all irregularities , particularly where there is fraud .
but the aim of the proposed measures will be to assist in the timely identification of bad , imprudent or fraudulent management , which can threaten the health and reputation of the system as a whole .
28 . the standing committee on company law reform , which first met in may 1984 , has made a number of recommendations to improve the operation of the companies and securities ordinances .
these recommendations are now being considered with a view to introducing legislation to implement them .
the standing committee has recently published a report on disclosure of beneficial interests in shareholdings and dealings in shares on a significant scale .
this report recommends the introduction of legislation to provide for a greater degree of disclosure of the true ownership of public companies listed on the stock exchange .
this would benefit shareholders , company management , the securities industry and regulatory authorities .
this too will be carefully considered by the government .
29 . the stock exchanges unification ( amendment ) ordinance and the securities ( amendment ) ordinance , enacted in august , pave the way for unification of the four stock exchanges .
they introduce new membership criteria , as well as more stringent financial requirements to help to ensure the financial viability of dealers .
new statutory stock exchange listing rules , and amendments to the compensation scheme set up under the securities ordinance to provide greater protection for the investing public , are now being prepared .
the unified exchange is expected to commence operation in 1986 .
30 . a review of the commodities trading ordinance , necessitated by the rapidly changing character of the futures industry , is also under way . it too seeks to improve the existing regulatory framework and afford greater protection to investors .
the executive council , on the recommendation of the securities and commodities trading commissions , has approved trading in hang seng index futures contracts . the futures exchange is expected to introduce this type of contract shortly .
31 . consumer protection is a matter of much concern both to the public and the government .
the last session of this council saw the introduction of legislation to regulate the business transactions of money changers and to provide for the registration of travel agents .
in recent months , the activities of an unscrupulous minority of retailers have received widespread publicity .
measures have already been taken to strengthen enforcement under existing legislation , and new measures to improve the law are in preparation .
( d ) trade and industry 32 . i turn now to trade and industry .
these are the foundation of our economy . the recent growth in protectionist sentiment in the united states poses a serious threat to our economic interests .
the united states customs regulations , prescribing country of origin requirements for multi-fibre arrangement textile products , were imposed in april this year .
they made no concessions on knitwear , despite hong kong &apos;s strong protests and a ruling by the textiles surveillance body in hong kong &apos;s favour .
the knitwear industry , as a result , has had to make major , costly investments , but has yet to adjust fully to the new requirements .
if passed into law , the bill will seriously undermine not only world trade in textiles , but the very principles on which the multi-fibre arrangement and the general agreement on tariffs and trade are based .
credit may be given deservedly to the government , to industry , and to trade and industry organisations , in particular the trade development council , for their concerted efforts in lobbying against the bill .
we shall not relax our efforts to counteract all protectionist moves which threaten our livelihood .
we applaud the stand taken by the united states administration against protectionism .
34 . the current multi-fibre arrangement will expire in july 1986 , and negotiations on its future have started .
the government will continue to work closely with other developing , textile-exporting countries to promote the liberalisation of trade in textiles and clothing .
35 . an exhibition and conference centre of the highest international standard is now being built by the trade development council on a site at wanchai reclamation , and is scheduled for completion in 1988 .
i congratulate the trade development council for so readily and enthusiastically taking on this exciting project . 36 .
on the industrial front , reflecting confidence in hong kong , there has been a rise in investment in new plant and machinery during the first half of this year ; this should help us to maintain an edge over our competitors .
during the last few months , the take-up of new leases at our industrial estates has accelerated .
37 . i shall now turn to matters which relate specifically to the implementation of the sino- british joint declaration .
( a ) general 38 . when i addressed this council last year , the sino-british joint declaration on the question of hong kong had just been initialled and published as a draft agreement , and the assessment office had begun its task of gauging public reaction to it .
there followed debates on the draft agreement , both in this council and in the united kingdom parliament .
subsequently , the joint declaration was signed by the british prime minister and the chinese premier on 19 december 1984 , and entered into force on 27 may 1985 upon ratification by the two governments .
it has been registered by both governments at the united nations , thus confirming its status as a binding international instrument .
( b ) joint liaison group 39 . the joint liaison group held its first meeting in july in london . both sides agreed on the importance of the general agreement on tariffs and trade to hong kong &apos;s economic development , and on arrangements for hong kong to continue as a member of the asian development bank after 1997 .
the group will meet again in peking towards the end of november .
by its very nature , the joint liaison group is not a body that will make a string of momentous decisions at each meeting . but it will , between now and the year 2000 , need to discuss a wide range of matters related to the implementation of the joint declaration .
the encouraging start that the group has made augurs well for the ability of the two sides to co- operate in this important work .
( c ) land commission 40 . the land commission too has set about its work quickly and effectively , and in a spirit of co-operation between the two sides .
it has reached agreement on a range of legal documents for use in land transactions , and on the land disposal programme for the remainder of the current financial year .
in september and earlier this month , the first public auctions of government land since the entry into force of the joint declaration were successfully held , and seven lots of land were sold for terms running up to 2047 .
all concerned can be confident that land will continue to be made available to meet hong kong &apos;s development requirements .
( d ) nationality and passports 41 . of considerable public interest are the arrangements for the introduction of british national ( overseas ) status and the issue of british national ( overseas ) passports .
any person , who is a british dependent territories citizen by virtue of a connection with hong kong , may apply for a british national ( overseas ) passport before 1997 , and will be able to use the passport after that date .
as has already been announced , arrangements are being made for these passports to be issued with effect from 1 july 1987 . this will enable the present practice of issuing passports for a ten-year validity period to continue without interruption . it will also give maximum time to third countries to grow accustomed to the new passports .
the format of the british national ( overseas ) passport will be such that it is readily identifiable as a document issued under the authority of the british government .
the british government has undertaken to do its utmost to obtain international recognition of that passport , and there are already encouraging signs that this will be accorded .
the british government has also announced that it will make provision for the children of former hong kong british dependent territories citizens , and for their grandchildren , to acquire british overseas citizenship , if they would otherwise be stateless .
42 . in february this year , during the committee stage of the hong kong bill in the house of commons , the minister of state said that the british government would discuss with the chinese authorities the wording of a statement to be included in the british national ( overseas ) passport to satisfy immigration officials in third countries that an individual has the right of abode in hong kong .
i am pleased to report that these discussions are proceeding .
43 . a draft order in council on british national ( overseas ) status has recently been published .
i urge all those concerned to put forward their views on it , so that these can be taken into account when it is debated in this council and in parliament .
( e ) hong kong register of shipping 44 . the joint declaration provides that the future hong kong special administrative region shall be authorised to continue to maintain a shipping register and to issue related certificates under its own legislation .
the government published in may its initial thinking for a new register and asked for public comment ; there has been a constructive response from the shipping industry .
over the next few months it should be possible to see more clearly the shape of hong kong &apos;s future policy in this field . ( f ) basic law 45 . the joint declaration records the basic policies of the people &apos;s republic of china regarding hong kong .
annex i to the joint declaration elaborates these policies , which will be stipulated in a basic law of the hong kong special administrative region of the people &apos;s republic of china , to be passed by the national people &apos;s congress .
46 . both the british government and the government of china are firmly committed to maintaining the prosperity and stability of hong kong and to ensuring a smooth transition in 1997 .
both the british government , which will remain responsible for the administration of hong kong up to 1997 , and the chinese government , which is responsible for drafting the basic law , have as their starting point the joint declaration , which sets out in annex i the general principles of the structure of government for the future .
both governments have pledged themselves to consult extensively with the people of hong kong . i am sure that the two governments will at all times be alive to the concerns and the views of the other , as well as of the views of the people of hong kong .
i am also confident that , on these foundations , a framework of enduring institutions can be constructed , which will maintain confidence in hong kong and enable a smooth transfer of government in 1997 .
( g ) annual report to parliament 47 . in february this year , as a result of representations from all parties , her majesty &apos;s government agreed to produce an annual report on hong kong , and to lay it before the british parliament .
the purpose of the report is to keep parliament informed on a regular basis of developments in hong kong during the period leading up to 1997 . it will thus demonstrate the continuing interest of the british parliament in the fortunes and progress of hong kong . the first report is expected to be published as a white paper and laid before the british parliament later this year .
( 5 ) social programme areas 48 . i shall turn now to our social programmes .
( a ) education 49 . our community has always placed great value on education .
this year , 17 per cent of total public expenditure is devoted to it ; this is more than is spent on any other single area of government activity .
the government remains committed to continuous improvement in educational opportunities and in the quality of education .
( i ) extension of education opportunities 50 . since 1978 , the cornerstone of our education policy has been nine years of universal , free and compulsory education .
the government is already committed to improve on this .
following the education commission &apos;s advice , we have set ourselves the target of providing by 1991 enough subsidised places , in forms iv and v in secondary schools , and in one-year full-time craft courses in technical institutes and training centres , to satisfy the demand for post-form iii education .
this should permit the phasing-out of the junior secondary education assessment system .
to do this , we shall have to build another 24 secondary schools as well as purchase places in forms iv and v from good private schools .
with the opening of the new technical institutes at tuen mun and sha tin in the coming year , overall student numbers in technical institutes will rise from 45 500 to over 52 000 . this represents some 2 700 more students at the technician level , and nearly 3 900 more students engaged in craft-level courses .
( ii ) language in education 51 . the education commission has recommended that hong kong should educate its younger generation to be more competent in both chinese and english .
hong kong &apos;s position as an important industrial , commercial and financial centre , now and in the future , requires our best efforts to ensure that our children can use both languages with ease .
this means improved teacher education ; more teachers , and more equipment .
52 . the language of teaching has been under review , as well as the teaching of language .
those secondary schools which teach in english will be asked to consider whether they wish to make greater use of chinese .
the availability of suitable textbooks will be an important factor for secondary schools contemplating such a change .
the government intends to establish a chinese textbooks committee . its purpose will be to ensure that sufficient secondary school textbooks of good quality , written in chinese , become available within the next five years .
more widespread use of chinese is in no way intended to diminish the importance of a high standard of english .
our objective , which we believe to be achievable , is high standards in both .
( iii ) computer education 53 . i spoke last year of the need to ensure that our young people develop a familiarity with the use and operation of computers .
following the successful implementation of the computer studies pilot scheme in 1982 , the scheme has grown to cover , by last month , a total of 210 government and government-aided secondary schools .
it is intended that all aided secondary schools should , if they so wish , include computer studies in their form iv and form v curricula from september 1986 .
an essential part of this programme is the training of more teachers .
the education department provides in-service training courses for teachers from schools taking part in the scheme ; the two universities and the hong kong polytechnic provide other training courses to increase the number of teachers qualified in computer studies .
earlier this year , a capital grant of $ 4 million from the maclehose fund was approved to set up a fully equipped computer education centre .
this will provide further training for teachers involved in the use and application of computers .
( iv ) higher education 54 . another area under review is the availability of places for our students at universities and polytechnics .
the joint funding scheme for hong kong students in britain has become a valued source of subsidised places in higher education , additional to the places which are available locally .
in 1984-85 there were over 1 300 successful applications for grants under this scheme , the cost of which is shared equally with the british government .
in 1985-86 , the amount available for grants has increased slightly to 瞿 4 million .
55 . first and foremost , however , we need to do more to provide places locally for our students .
we have 28 000 full-time and equivalent part-time students in our institutions of higher learning , of whom some 13 000 are on degree courses .
until now , the target figure for first-year places in first degree courses by 1994-95 has been just over 6 300 .
present indications are that this is not enough to meet either the requirements of our economy or the aspirations of our students .
the government intends therefore to proceed with the planning of a third university , and thereby increase the provision of first-year , first degree places to over 7 500 .
the university and polytechnic grants committee has advised that , with a third university , this should be possible within the 1990s .
much work needs to be done on this project ; the cost will be considerable ; but the objective is clear , and i have no doubt that the investment will show an ample return .
( b ) housing 56 . this year will see record public housing production of over 48 000 flats , with the housing authority exceeding its annual production target for the sixth successive year .
the authority continues steadily to improve the quality of its new housing as well as upgrading and redeveloping existing stock .
as anticipated last year , private sector production has increased and is forecast to reach about 30 000 flats this calendar year , rising to about 33 000 units in 1986 .
about 18 000 flats are scheduled for completion next year under the home ownership and private sector participation schemes .
57 . meanwhile , the restructured squatter clearance programme , which i mentioned last year , has started ; and the rural housing programme continues to make steady progress , with a project at tui min hoi in sai kung due to be completed later this year , and projects at mui wo on lantau and at sha tau kok scheduled to start next year .
58 . honourable members will be aware that the public is being consulted on the level of housing subsidy to public housing tenants .
the housing authority will examine carefully all public comments on the suggestions set out in its green paper , together with alternative ideas which come forward , before deciding whether any recommendations should be made to the executive council . ( c ) social welfare 59 . last year , i spoke of the housing needs of the increasing number of elderly people in our population .
in july , the housing authority agreed to provide self-care hostels in public housing estates for elderly people still enjoying good health . the authority plans to provide hostels for some 2 000 people over the next six years .
these will be in addition to the existing quota of shared flats and housing units for single persons in public housing estates .
these arrangements will help the social welfare department and welfare agencies in their task of looking after those elderly people who are unable to care for themselves .
60 . residential institutions have long provided services catering for children and young people who , because of family circumstances or their own behaviour , have to live away from their families .
in recent years , limited arrangements have been made to care for children outside these institutions .
a working group has recently been established to look into this area , and to report to the social welfare advisory committee .
( d ) medical services 61 . during the past year , the government has undertaken to meet the cost of major extensions to subvented hospitals .
a capital subvention of $ 680 million will provide a 760- bed extension for the united christian hospital by 1991 , which will more than double its present size .
another subvention of $ 224 million will provide for capacity at the yan chai hospital to increase from 150 to 700 beds by 1988 .
funds have also been provided to allow continuation of the phased expansion of the pok oi hospital .
62 . as part of a review of the management organisation of hospital services in hong kong , consultants have been assessing the potential for better integration between government and subvented hospitals ; their report is expected before the end of the year .
( e ) environment 63 . as i stated in my address last year , the government is well aware of the need to protect the environment in which we live and work .
proposals for enforceable controls on the disposal of untreated animal wastes , which are the cause of some of the most severe pollution problems , will soon be considered by district boards and other interested parties .
it is hoped to introduce measures , together with the necessary legislation , during the present session .
proposals to improve controls on air pollution will be submitted to the executive council during the first half of next year .
the nature and scale of noise problems are less easily defined than most other pollution problems , and acceptable objective measurements of noise are difficult to establish .
it is , nevertheless , hoped to introduce a noise control bill into the legislative council before the end of the present session . ( f ) broadcasting 64 . in august , the broadcasting review board submitted its report on the future of broadcasting in hong kong .
the report , which was published last month , makes several proposals .
one of these , the turning of radio television hong kong into an independent public broadcaster with guaranteed access to television prime time , has excited considerable public comment .
but there are many others , equally important and equally deserving of discussion .
they include the establishment of a new broadcasting authority ; greater control over commercial broadcasting ; the prohibition of tobacco advertising on radio and television ; and the provision of a modern cable television distribution network .
during the next three months , public comment will be welcomed on all these recommendations .
the government will take all views fully into account when drawing up proposals for the broadcasting policies to be adopted after the expiry of the present licences in 1988 .
the decisions to be taken are far-reaching . they will shape the future of television and broadcasting in hong kong for a long time to come .
they will therefore need to be soundly based and acceptable to the community as a whole .
65 . i shall move on now to our development programme .
( a ) territorial development strategy ( i ) urban growth 66 . our strategy is aimed at sustaining long-term urban growth .
in preparation for the early 1990s , detailed planning and engineering studies on new growth areas around the harbour are now under way .
initially , reclamation will take place at kellett bay on the western shore of hong kong island to provide land for public housing ; and at hung hom bay to provide land for expansion of the kcr terminal , for residential development , and for government and institutional facilities much needed in this part of kowloon .
( ii ) new town development 67 . advance engineering work for the tin shui wai new town is coming along well . formation work is due to begin next year to provide land to house 135 000 people .
by 1995 , the population of the north-western new territories , including tuen mun , will have risen to over 700 000 .
to cater for the expected travel demands in this region , work on the light rail transit system will commence early next year ; the system is expected to start running in 1988 .
68 . major engineering works and public housing construction are also under way in junk bay , and the first residents of the new town will move in by early 1987 . the town will accommodate up to 155 000 people by about 1994 , and will be linked to east kowloon by a new road tunnel on which work will start next year .
there is good progress also on the redevelopment of sha tau kok , where priority is being given to re-housing over 3 000 residents living in unsatisfactory accommodation .
69 . the momentum of new town development in the new territories is being reinforced by large investment in transport infrastructure , about which i shall say more when i speak about the road network .
( b ) land and building 70 . the government is concerned that the redevelopment of the older parts of our city should proceed in parallel with new development .
to this end , the government intends to establish a land development corporation , and legislation for this purpose is being drafted .
when constituted , the land development corporation will co-operate with private developers and owners of run-down properties in the older urban areas to produce new housing .
this will be built to modern standards and equipped with a full range of commercial , community and welfare facilities .
the first project should get under way in the next 12 months ; i am hopeful that this initiative will give a strong impetus to the renovation of areas such as western district , wanchai , yaumatei and mong kok .
( c ) communications 71 . the volume of shipping using hong kong &apos;s port facilities has continued to increase , highlighting the need for the port development strategy study , to which i referred last year . this is now reaching its conclusion .
it is imperative that hong kong maintains its capacity to handle promptly and effectively the cargoes which pass through our port .
this study should tell us just what facilities will be needed and where they should be .
72 . as for more immediate needs at the container terminal , reclamation of kwai chung creek to provide 25 additional hectares of land is ahead of schedule , and will be completed by early 1987 .
negotiations are well advanced for the addition of an ambitious three-berth terminal at kwai chung , with the reclamation of a further 29 hectares .
( d ) transport ( i ) road network 73 . improvements to the road network continued during the year .
the completion of the island eastern corridor as far as shau kei wan has greatly improved road communications between the eastern part of hong kong island and the remainder of the urban area .
the opening last month of the section of the new territories trunk road from sha tin to fan ling will bring substantial benefit to the north-east new territories .
further road improvements on which work will commence during the coming year include the construction of the new tunnel link between sha tin and tsuen wan . 74 .
earlier this year , it was decided that the eastern harbour crossing should provide both road and rail facilities .
the road tunnel will alleviate congestion through the present cross harbour tunnel and will greatly assist the fulfilment of our territorial development strategy .
the additional mass transit railway crossing will relieve pressure on the nathan road section of the railway and bring other transport benefits .
the government is now negotiating with several consortia which have submitted the most promising proposals for the construction , operation and financing of the crossing .
construction is expected to commence in early 1986 and will take about three and a half years to complete .
( ii ) cross-border links 75 . during the year , new facilities designed to improve communications between hong kong and the shenzen special economic zone were opened . they include the second bridge at man kam to , the new bridge at sha tau kok and a new footbridge at lo wu .
work has also begun on the construction of the first stage of the lok ma chau bridge ; this is expected to be completed in early 1988 .
these improvements to cross-border links will provide sufficient capacity to cope with the expected growth of traffic into the next decade .
( iii ) traffic congestion 76 . experience has shown that the roads in busy urban areas cannot cope with unrestrained traffic growth ; such growth can result in severe and widespread congestion at a high economic cost .
fiscal measures , introduced in may 1982 , have reduced the number of private cars on the road ; but they impose a burden on all car owners regardless of whether they are heavy users of congested roads .
the measures , though so far effective , are a blunt instrument . other , more equitable and more efficient methods of tackling congestion must be considered , so that we can obtain maximum economic benefit from our expensive road network .
consultation on such measures , including the question of whether any form of electronic road pricing should be introduced , and if so , where and when , is still in progress in the transport advisory committee .
77 . there is increasing congestion at the northern entrance to the lion rock tunnel . the number of toll collection booths does not match the tunnel capacity .
to remedy this , three additional toll booths are being built ; they should be operational by march next year .
other measures are being investigated to improve traffic flow through the tunnel , including the possibility of automatic toll collection .
in addition , the feasibility of a road tunnel under tate &apos;s cairn , linking sha tin with east kowloon , is being closely examined .
( iv ) public transport 78 . the opening of the mass transit railway island line from chai wan to admiralty has increased patronage on the mass transit railway by about 300 000 boardings a day .
the extension of this line to sheung wan , passing through central , will be completed in the early summer of 1986 .
this is expected to lead to a further increase in the number of passengers using the island line .
( 7 ) law , order and security ( a ) crime 79 . 1985 will probably show a slight increase over 1984 in recorded crime , due largely to an increase in burglary and shoplifting .
by contrast , the decrease in violent crime recorded in 1984 has continued in 1985. with a further reduction in the number of robberies and cases involving firearms .
an aggressive crime prevention campaign continues under the guidance of the fight crime committee .
i have asked the committee to give high priority to further measures to combat the insidious menace of triads .
80 . commercial crime has increased noticeably in recent years and the trend in large scale frauds facilitated by corruption. to which i referred last year , has unhappily continued .
crime of this nature damages the community and besmirches hong kong &apos;s reputation internationally .
a strengthened commercial crime bureau is spearheading an assault on commercial crime , and some 30 per cent of the icac &apos;s operations department are now directed to investigations in this field .
during the last session , i commended the work of the select committee on complex commercial crime .
i shall invite the council to consider the continuation of this work by reappointment of the select committee for the coming session .
81 . corruption reports received by the icac have in total shown an increase of 7 per cent so far this year , with a more marked increase of 16 per cent in reports relating to the private sector .
as part of the continuing effort against corruption in the private sector , the commissioner has recently formed a corruption prevention advisory services group which , on request , advises private businesses and companies on ways in which the risk of corrupt practices may be minimised .
this service has been drawn to the attention of government- listed contractors and subvented organisations , and is available to members of professional and business societies and associations .
( b ) police 82 . we shall continue to rely on our efficient and dedicated police force to maintain law and order during and beyond the transition of the territory to a special administrative region .
having regard to the terms of the joint declaration , it is clear that the force must undergo some changes , among other things in the staffing of the senior ranks .
we foresee a valuable role for expatriate police officers ; the force must nevertheless achieve localisation at a faster pace than hitherto .
at the same time , we must not jeopardise the force &apos;s efficiency , nor endanger its high level of morale .
i expect soon to receive recommendations on how such objectives can best be achieved , from a steering group comprising the commissioner of police , the secretary for security and the secretary for the civil service .
83 . in the meantime , the force and its resources are being continually modernised to meet changing policing requirements .
in the coming year , work will start on the building of a new headquarters complex .
the fleet of divisional patrol craft will reach full strength in december this year , when the marine police take delivery of their last new craft in an order of 15 .
( c ) narcotics 84 . events over the past 12 months also indicate that the government and the community must continue to be on guard against the ever-present threat of drug abuse .
the progress made in 1984 and in the first quarter of 1985 in reducing the number of newly reported drug abusers is in danger of being eroded by the lowest heroin prices ever recorded , and by the persistence of the drug traffickers ; notwithstanding the relentless efforts of the police and customs which have led to many successful prosecutions and often heavy sentences .
preventive education among the young by the action committee against narcotics will continue .
85 . there is a growing and world-wide interest in measures to deprive convicted drug traffickers of their ill-gotten and enormous profits .
the government is closely examining the measures which have been adopted or are being considered by other countries , with a view to deciding on a practicable approach for hong kong in tackling this international problem .
( d ) vietnamese refugees 86 . vietnamese refugees continue to arrive in hong kong , although the &quot; closed centre &quot; policy has reduced the influx .
the rate of resettlement remains disappointingly low ; many refugees have been in camps here for up to five years .
in september , the british government announced a relaxation of its family reunion criteria for vietnamese held in camps in countries of temporary asylum .
this means that about 500 such refugees currently in hong kong will become eligible for resettlement in the united kingdom .
the british government will also consider accepting further limited numbers of refugees from hong kong , provided other countries do the same .
for our part , we are prepared to accept a limited number of ethnic chinese , but only as part of a widely concerted international attempt to reduce our vietnamese refugee population .
both governments have mounted a major diplomatic effort to this end .
( e ) correctional services 87 . as part of the continuing effort to persuade criminals not to resume criminal activity when they leave prison , the government plans to introduce legislation to provide for the establishment of a type of parole scheme in hong kong .
under this scheme , prisoners fulfilling certain conditions will be eligible for release under supervision before completing their sentences .
under a related scheme , certain prisoners may be allowed to leave prison to take up pre-release employment , again under supervision .
both schemes are designed to provide an opportunity for prisoners to re-integrate into society , without falling prey to elements likely to induce them to revert to criminal practices .
( f ) fire services 88 . substantial human and financial losses are suffered each year as a result of fire , in particular because of the way in which fire-fighting is frequently hampered by goods and other obstacles stacked in common areas of buildings .
the government plans to introduce amendments to present legislation. making it a direct offence to place movable objects in corridors or on staircases . locking gates across escape routes will also be made a specific offence .
( g ) legal aid 89 . the last comprehensive review of legal aid services took place in 1971 .
at that time the government was spending $ 1.5 million per annum on limited services ; today it is spending a little over $ 80 million per annum on a much wider range of services .
allowing for the impact of inflation. this represents more than a ten-fold increase over 15 years .
a working party is examining all matters relating to this important aspect of our legal system .
when its review has been completed , there will be full consultation with the legal profession and other interest parties , probably in early 1986 .
90 . we are now in the third year of the campaign to stabilise the size of the civil service . i am pleased to announce that a large measure of success has been achieved : the civil service establishment has increased by only a little over 3 per cent since 1983 and has hardly grown at all over the last year .
the small increase has been due almost entirely to the need for additional staff to man new facilities and provide expanded services in areas such as health , education and law enforcement .
the achievement has come from improvements in work methods , and hence in productivity , within the civil service . much of this has been the direct result of initiatives taken by the staff themselves .
we are fortunate to have a loyal and dedicated civil service which has responded well to our efforts to maintain zero growth in recent years .
it is the intention that the civil service should stay lean , but there will be areas where additional staff are required to provide essential services to the community .
91 . the localisation policy which has been pursued since the 1960 &apos;s continues to bear fruit . local officers in increasing numbers are taking up senior positions , and the proportion of local officers in the directorate has climbed from 31 per cent in 1976 to 50 per cent in 1985 .
we shall continue with localisation , taking care to ensure. however , that efficiency and morale are not jeopardised .
there is now a sufficiently large and growing pool of local talent at middle and senior levels for us to be confident that we shall be able to fill top posts with local people. in terms of the joint declaration , before 1997 .
but there will still be a place for overseas officers , whose services are highly valued . their employment in the government after 1997 is provided for under the joint declaration .
92 . in conclusion , i trust that honourable members will agree that the imaginative and ambitious policies and programmes , which you have heard me describe today , are evidence that your government is conducting its affairs with a clear purpose .
we intend to promote steady progress combined with stability and to continue the improvement in the quality of life in hong kong .
we shall continue to formulate and execute policies which will fulfil this purpose .
we shall continue to seek out and respond to the public will .
93 . honourable members , the government will rely heavily on your support and advice in this endeavour .
i am confident you will ably discharge this responsibility in the best interests of hong kong .
adjourned accordingly at twenty minutes to seven o &apos;clock .

safety at k.c.r. &apos; s university station
1 . mr. s. l. chen asked : - will the government inform this council what has been done to improve the safety at k.c.r. &apos; s university station where two incidents of children falling onto the track have been reported this year ?
secretary for transport : - sir , because of the physical constraints of the site university station is built on a curve in the railway line and there is a wider gap between the platforms and the trains than at stations where the tracks and platforms are straight .
the width of the gap along the whole length of the platforms is however within international safety limits and the station has been passed as safe for public use by the railway inspector .
nevertheless it has been the k.c.r. corporation &apos;s practice since the station opened in 1983 to make frequent announcements in english and in chinese , both on the trains as they approach the station , and on the platforms to make sure that passengers are mindful of the gap and take care when boarding or alighting from trains .
a further possibility being examined is to have special lighting under the platforms to make sure the gap is clearly visible after dark .
i can assure members that the corporation would do everything possible to ensure that there are no further accidents .
mr. wong po-yan : - sir , is it possible to make the gap narrower than the international safety limit to avoid the accidents ; if not , why not ?
secretary for transport : - sir , because of the curvature of the line at that point , it is not possible to ensure that the gap between the carriages and the platform is narrower than at present . it is also necessary to take account of the rather wider bodies of the chinese through trains which means this gap has to be there .
court of final appeal
2 . mr. cheung yan-lung asked : - will the government inform this council whether plans are being made for the setting up of a court of final appeal in hong kong ?
the attorney general : - sir , as i indicated in a debate just one year ago in this council , it is desirable that a court of final appeal should be established in hong kong well before 1997 in order to ensure a smooth transition .
as i said then , the court ought to have the opportunity , well before 1997 , to build a reputation for authoritative judgments and earn the confidence of hong kong people and the international business community .
there are however no plans yet for the establishment of the court .
it is bound to take some time to examine the implications and to identify the various options which are consistent with the implementation of the joint declaration .
miss dunn : - sir , is an exercise underway to identify and examine the options ?
the attorney general : - sir , as i said there are no plans yet . i said that it would be bound to take some time to carry out this examination and the work has scarcely begun .
mr. martin lee : - sir , will the attorney general please inform this council as to when we will expect that this final court of appeal can be established in hong kong ?
the attorney general : - sir , i would really prefer not to commit myself to a date at this stage .
as i have said a good deal of preparatory work is still to be done and it is hoped that it will be established well before 1997 .
mr. peter c. wong : - sir , will the attorney general inform this council when he will begin his preparatory work ?
the attorney general : - sir , it is too early to forecast when that work will begin . there are other more important matters to be dealt with at this stage and i would guess , if that answer is sufficient to my learned friend , i would guess that the work will begin in earnest in about two or three years &apos; time .
mr. swaine : - sir , would the government agree that it is of paramount importance that the composition of the proposed final court of appeal should be such as to command international respect and that in this context quality rather than time is of the essence ?
the attorney general : - sir , i would agree with that proposition entirely . social welfare programmes
3 . mr. hui yin-fat asked : - will government inform this council whether it has sufficient revenue in this financial year to maintain existing social welfare programmes including the provision of salary adjustments for subvented voluntary welfare agencies staff , as well as to implement all the approved expansion and improvement projects in the five year plan for social welfare development ?
secretary for health and welfare : - sir , the provision of $ 420 million in the social welfare subventions head for the present financial year is sufficient to maintain the existing services operated by the subvented welfare agencies .
sufficient funds are also available to meet the salary adjustment , although it may be necessary to seek supplementary provision to cover this requirement at a later stage in the financial year .
the five year plan for social welfare development identified 64 new projects for implementation this year ; funds are available for allocation to 51 of these projects , and this represents all the projects which are likely to be ready to come into operation before the end of the financial year .
the five year plan review also identified a number of improvements to the quality of existing services . in view of the limited funds available it was decided , on the advice of the subventions and lotteries fund advisory committee , to accord priority to the new projects , i have already mentioned , and i fear that it will not be possible to implement these improvements this year .
mr. hui yin-fat : - sir , in view of the reply just given by the secretary for health and welfare it seems that government is giving higher priority to extension plans than improvements to the quality of the existing services which have been delayed repeatedly .
sir , may i ask the government that a certain degree of assurance be given that the improvement of quality of existing services be given higher priority when funds are available in the near future ?
secretary for health and welfare : - sir , i can give an assurance that this will be carefully considered when we know exactly how much money we are provided with in the budget next year .
i will ask the director of social welfare to do this .
mrs. rosanna tam : - sir , may i ask the government since there are sufficient revenue for salary adjustments why can &apos;t the government speed up the process to an acceptable level of giving such adjustments to subvented voluntary welfare agencies for the sake of fairness and good working morale ?
secretary for health and welfare : - sir , i accept that this year there was an unfortunate delay in deciding precisely how much money to allocate to category 2 services .
this problem has been carefully thought through and i hope that next year we will not have the same problem .
mr. stephen cheong : - sir , as a complete novice to the social welfare field , could the secretary for health and welfare be kind enough to elucidate whether or not the quality of existing service is totally dependent on the funds available ?
secretary for health and welfare : - sir , quality is always an elusive item but to some extent it depends on the level of staff provided in the different services .
it must depend on the money available and i think what mr. hui was referring to was a number of proposals to provide additional staff for particular types of service , and that is what i fear we have not been able to implement this year .
concrete deterioration in buildings
4 . miss dunn asked : - in the light of a recent report that there is concrete deterioration in hong kong &apos;s buildings , would the government inform this council :
( a ) whether such a problem exists and if so ; ( b ) what is the scale of the problem in the public and private sectors ; and ( c ) what actions are being taken to remedy it ?
secretary for lands and works : - sir , yes , a problem exists with regard to concrete deterioration in hong kong &apos;s buildings .
however , this problem is not a serious one at present but it is growing .
given good workmanship and proper material , concrete buildings can have an extremely long life .
in the private sector , over the last two decades , 31 buildings have been demolished because of serious defective concrete , representing about 0.12 per cent of all concrete framed buildings in the territory .
in the public sector , in view of the regular maintenance programme , the situation is significantly better and there are no cases of defective concrete which cause the building to be in a state of imminent failure .
both preventive and remedial measures are taken to overcome the problem of concrete deterioration of buildings .
provisions under the buildings ordinance require all construction materials to comply with standard specification and the submission of certificates of origin , chemical composition and strength tests results of steel reinforcement prior to construction .
during construction , test reports on concrete cubes are required and at various stages buildings ordinance office staff carry out site inspections .
after construction , planned surveys are conducted by the buildings ordinance office staff who also respond to reports from the general public .
where buildings require attention , repair orders are served on owners .
in default situations , direct action is taken by government .
miss dunn : - sir , does the government have an effective system to monitor and identify buildings which are in need of repairs other than relying on reports by tenants ?
secretary forlands and works : - apart from action in response to report from the general public or referral from other departments , the buildings ordinance office has a planned survey programme .
the planned survey programme covers the older buildings in the urban areas starting with pre-war buildings and following-up with the older post-war buildings and from this planned survey programme any problems seen and detected will be attended to .
mr. cheng hon-kwan : - sir , despite what the secretary for lands and works has said , does the government have any plan of updating and improving the present standards for concrete strength and durability ?
secretary forlands and works : - revised building ( construction ) regulations covering the specification of concrete and the way it is to be constructed have already been agreed in the buildings ordinance review subcommittee of the previous building development advisory committee .
drafting instructions for amending the legislation are being prepared and in due course a bill will be submitted to this council for consideration .
mr. jackie chan asked in cantonese : - ( the following is the interpretation of his question . ) sir , it has been mentioned just now that most of the buildings in the older districts like wan chai , yau ma tei and mong kok might have problems .
may i ask the government whether it is necessary for the government to take action in monitoring the management of the building as well so as to improve the situation ?
what i mean is : is it possible for government to take action to step up management in buildings ?
secretary forlands and works replied in cantonese : - ( the following is the interpretation of his reply . ) mr. chan mentioned the question of management of multi-storey buildings , this problem can be indirectly related to the safety of structure of buildings .
the government &apos;s stand is : we will try our best to encourage owners of various buildings to form owners &apos; corporations and mutual aid committees to manage their buildings properly .
this is the present government policy .
illegal tapping of water and electricity in squatter areas 5 . dr. conrad lam asked in cantonese : - ( the following is the translation of his question . )
with regard to the illegal use of water and electricity in certain squatter areas , will the government inform this council what plans it has to improve the situation ?
secretary for housing : - sir , the problem of illegal tapping of water supply in squatter areas exists mainly where standpipe water supply is available .
the obvious solution to this problem is therefore the provision of a metered connection .
to this end . water supplies department &apos;s current programme to provide metered supply to 740 squatter areas and n.t. villages is scheduled to be completed in about three years &apos; time .
in parallel to this , under the squatter areas improvement programme . housing department is at present carrying out 11 similar projects in squatter areas , with a further 45 projects planned over the next three years .
with the completion of all these projects , the majority of the squatter areas in the territory will have a metered supply , and we are confident that the problem of illegal tapping of water would no longer arise .
the problem of illegal tapping of electricity in squatter areas exists mainly where a legal supply is available and is most serious in wong tai sin and kwun tong .
the problem is being tackled on two fronts , namely , enforcement and education .
on the enforcement front , the police , in conjunction with the power company , city and new territories administration and housing department have stepped up action against such illegal activities .
since january this year , 236 persons involved in illegal tapping of electricity have been arrested .
on the education front , the departments and the district boards concerned have intensified their efforts to educate residents about the dangers of tapping electricity illegally and advise them to apply for a legal connection .
furthermore , the fight crime committee is also concerned about the triad involvement in the illegal supplies of water and electricity in squatter areas .
a working group on &apos; gangs &apos; under the committee has studied the problems and its recommendations are being considered by the departments concerned .
the long term solution to eliminate these illegal tapping activities in squatter areas lies in the clearance of the squatter areas themselves .
as mentioned in your address last week , sir , our plan to clear and rehouse all squatters in the urban areas within five to ten years has already started .
dr. conrad lam asked in cantonese : - ( the following is the interpretation of his question . ) sir , on the question of gangs being active in the squatter areas , aside from paragraph 3 of the answer saying that recommendations will be considered , when will we see actual work being done ?
secretary for housing : - the matter is being carefully looked into by all the departments concerned .
no doubt it would be more desirable to quicken the work on the water supplies department &apos;s individual metered supply programme .
naturally all departments concerned are very concerned with the matter and we are doing our best to expedite the work .
gifted children 6 .
mr. martin lee asked : - does the administration have any policy or programme relating to the teaching of specially gifted children ?
secretary for education and manpower : - under current policy there is no specific programme or institution provided to cater for specially gifted children presuming this phrase to mean intellectually gifted .
hong kong &apos;s educational system aims to provide a broad and balanced education for all pupils .
and most teachers should also be able to recognise the specially gifted child and can provide the level of work to develop that child &apos;s potential if necessary and also specialist advice is available from the education department if needed .
in addition schools at all levels are encouraged to develop a varied programme of extra- curricular activities to meet the needs of those pupils whose talents can more readily be developed through specially organised interest groups such as mathematics , science and social studies clubs .
i should add perhaps that where the artistically gifted are concerned the advent of the academy of performing arts will provide a most encouraging environment for the development of their talents .
secretary for education and manpower : - sir , this is a subject on which i must confess i have no great expertise - the education of the specially gifted child .
i certainly agree with mr. lee to the extent that we must try to make the best of the talents of all our young people , whether this is best achieved in the way suggested by mr. lee i would have to consider and consult with the director of education .
mr. lee yu-tai : - sir , may i ask what form of specialist advice is available in the education department with regard to gifted children ?
secretary for education and manpower : - well , they have a number of specialists in the education department and initially advice will be bought , i think , from the advisory inspectorate in the subjects concerned .
mr. stephen cheong kam-chuen : - sir , forgive me , may i ask the definition of a &apos; gifted child &apos; ?
secretary for education and manpower : - this question has baffled many better minds than mine , i think , sir . ( laughter )
film classification system
7 . mrs. ng asked in cantonese : - ( the following is the translation of her question . ) will the government say whether and if so when the film classification system which has been under consideration for several years will be implemented , how it will be enforced ; and whether the existing film censorship standard will be relaxed because of this system ?
the chief secretary : - sir , the proposal to introduce a new film classification system is expected to be submitted to the governor in council in about a month .
assuming approval , a draft bill will be gazetted for public information and comment , and for examination by this council .
on the assumption that the bill becomes law , the system could be introduced by mid- 1986 .
with regard to enforcement , it is proposed that the onus be placed on cinema operators to ensure that only persons aged 18 or above are admitted to certain films . the film censorship authority would make spot checks on cinemas showing such films .
the level at which censorship standards is eventually set will depend upon the findings of an independently conducted public opinion survey .
mrs. ng asked in cantonese : - ( the following is the interpretation of her question . ) sir , regarding the age limit , has the government consulted the cinema operators and if so , what is their reaction to this ?
the chief secretary : - the film operators are supportive of this idea , sir .
mrs. ng asked in cantonese : - ( the following is the interpretation of her question . ) sir , in the process of considering whether we need to amend existing consorship standards , apart from conducting an independent public opinion survey , has the government considered consulting the district boards ?
the chief secretary : - yes , the district boards will be consulted .
illegal immigration 8 .
dr. ho asked : - will government inform this council :
( a ) the reasons why illegal immigration from china has increased in recent months ; and ( b ) what additional measures would government take to curb illegal immigration ?
the attorney general : - there are seasonal fluctuations in the number of illegal immigrants who attempt to enter hong kong due to weather , the harvest and so on . but there has been in recent months an increase greater than we would normally expect at this time of year .
the number of daily arrests made at the border this year so far is about a third higher than in the equivalent period last year .
the reasons are difficult to specify .
first , we are led to believe that rumours are circulating on the other side of the border that the introduction of a new identity card would be accompanied by a general amnesty for any illegal residents in hong kong .
i need hardly add , sir , that this is completely untrue .
rumours such as this are spread by those who seek to profit from the misfortune of would be illegal immigrants .
there will be no amnesty for any found to have entered hong kong illegally .
second , there is a belief that the recent announcement of the reduction of the british garrison by one battalion has resulted in a reduction in the security forces deployed at the border .
again , sir , nothing could be further from the truth .
there has been no reduction in the security forces at the border .
the withdrawal of the 2 / 7 gurkha rifles next year will be accompanied by increased periods of border duty for other battalions .
there will be no reduction in the number of security personnel patrolling the border and no loss of effectiveness .
however , and this is an encouraging sign , there are grounds for believing that the security forces using more sophisticated equipment are now catching at the border a higher proportion of illegal immigrants than before .
there is no sign yet of any comparable increase in the numbers of evaders surfacing in hong kong .
as regards additional measures , we can do no more than maintain our vigilance and keep up our guard .
we shall continue to discuss this problem through the various cross border channels available to us .
and we shall continue to spread the word to anyone who seeks to enter hong kong illegally that the chances of evading capture are very slim indeed .
dr. ho : - sir , in our talks with the chinese authorities across the border , will officers of the hong kong government be reminded to bring up or to stress the deterrent effect of the re- education camp practice or the labour camp practice which china employed previously in reforming the repatriated illegals ?
the attorney general : - sir , the subject of illegal immigrants has been discussed last month during the political adviser &apos;s joint working group review with the shenzhen authorities and . i understand , will be considered in the forthcoming border liaison meeting with the guangdong authorities later this month . so i shall pass on to those concerned the suggestion behind the supplementary question .
miss dunn : - sir , is there any reasons to believe that the rumours that the attorney general just referred to are fanned by organised syndicates involved in bringing in illegal immigrants for profit ?
the attorney general : - sir , so far as one can pronounce on these matters i &apos;m sure there is some truth in the suggestion of miss dunn .
those who seek to profit from illegal immigration will not lose the opportunity to sell the services and to boost the services which they offer .
miss dunn : - is anything being done to identify these syndicates ?
the attorney general : - i am sorry i did not catch the last part of the question .
miss dunn : - to identify the syndicates who are involved in bringing in illegal immigrants .
the attorney general : - so far as matters are within the control of the hong kong government of course through the processes of de-briefing that take place every time there is an arrest at the border , all information available is gathered and considered .
that information is no doubt passed on to those who are in a position to deal with the matter on the other side .
mrs. fan : - sir , since rumours seem effective in increasing the number of illegal immigrants trying to get into hong kong , is there any plan that the government have in mind to combat such rumour in a more effective manner ?
the attorney general : - sir , the government is i can say taking all steps they can to make known through channels of broadcast and news dissemination the realities of the matter .
the realities are those that i have spoken about and the more people who are thinking of seeking to enter hong kong illegally learn of the realities , the more they will be deterred .
mr. yeung po-kwan : - sir , in order to curb illegal immigration will the government review the operation procedures of the identity card inspectors of the labour department so that more inspections will be made to workplaces where illegal immigrants are more likely to get employment ?
the attorney general : - sir , like my honourable friend i have read in the newspapers of matters that are in hand in the labour department but i think that supplementary question is one which i ought to refer to the labour department itself . (
annex i )
supervision of banks
9 . mr. david li asked : - will the government inform this council of the on-going performance of and its plans for those banks currently under government supervision ?
the financial secretary : - sir , the straight answer to mr. li &apos;s question is that all licenced banks are under government supervision .
i cannot usefully comment on their performance of 143 banks or government &apos;s plans .
i think , however , that mr. li actually seeks information about hang lung , h.i.c.b. , and o.t.b. , and i shall try and give him a helpful answer on this basis .
a first class consultant has been engaged to value the hang lung bank and to advise on the form and timing of a devestiture .
the report is expected in about a month &apos;s time .
the actual form and timing of the sale will take account of that report , the public interest and the interest of the banks &apos; staff and customers .
i shall wish to consult executive council before making a final decision .
as to the o.t.b. and its subsidiary the hong kong industrial and commercial bank , no plans have yet been made , but it is the government &apos;s wish also to return these banks to the private sector as soon as commonsense indicates is possible .
a decision on o.t.b. seems unlikely for about two years . it may well prove possible to move more quickly with h.i.c.b. , but there are interconnected and other problems .
mr. david li : - sir , what terms of reference did the government set for the boards of those banks at present under government control , particularly in regard to organisation , personnel , credit policies with a view to restoring them to profitablility ?
the financial secretary : - sir , i haven &apos;t prepared the answer to that supplementary question and with your permission i will let mr. li have a reply in writing . ( annex ii )
pollution by lai chi kok incineration plant 10 . mr. chung pui-lam asked in cantonese : - ( the following is the translation of his question . )
in view of the serious stage of pollution caused by the lai chi kok incineration plant , can government inform this council :
( a ) what plan it has at present to control this kind of pollution ; ( b ) how long will it take to implement such a plan ; and ( c ) what temporary measures are in hand to alleviate the present situation ?
secretary for health and welfare : - sir , the air pollution problems caused by the lai chi kok incinerators are recognised by the government .
in the longer term the most effective solution will almost certainly by the phasing out of the incinerators and the centralisation of domestic refuse in one or more strategically located &apos; transfer stations &apos; from which it will be transported in large vehicles to the controlled tips in the new territories .
at present it is difficult to say when the development of these new methods will have reached a stage at which the incinerators can be closed down permanently .
interim measures therefore have to be considered ; there is already an item in category ab of the public works programme for the installation of electrostic precipitators which would remove most of the dust and grit which form the major part of the pollution caused by the lai chi kok incinerators .
these electrostatic precipitators are expensive ; they are estimated to cost about $ 130 million .
the question of whether interim measures involving costs of this magnitude can be justified has been extensively discussed within the government and i expect an early decision as to whether the upgrading of the project should be proposed to the public works sub- committee .
if it is decided to go ahead with the precipitators work should start in the 1986-87 financial year and some improvement would be achieved almost immediately as the first of the two plants would be closed down for the installation work to begin .
the work should be completed by 1990 .
on the other hand a decision not to instal precipitators and to rely on transfer stations would mean that the incinerators could not be closed down until 1989 at the earliest , although some improvement might be effected before then by the use of barges to transport refuse to the controlled tips . mr. chung pui-lam asked in cantonese : -
( the following is the interpretation of his question ) . sir , it has been mentioned that the installation of electrostatic precipitators would remove most of the dust and grit . can the secretary tell us the amount so removed in percentage terms ; can this electrostatic preciptators remove foul smell emitted from the incinerator ?
secretary for health and welfare : - sir , electrostatic precipitators basically remove what it is known in the trade as particulate matter , that is dust and grit , and they do not remove other gases which emerge from the chimneys .
to some extent i think the smell would be reduced .
i understand in fact that the gases which come from the lai chi kok incinerators are not particularly dangerous to health in the sense that they do not breach the levels which are accepted internationally as being proper for this sort of activity .
i cannot guarantee that all the smell will be removed .
policy on promotion of civic education
11 . mr. szeto wah asked in cantonese : - ( the following is the translation of his question . ) the administration has confirmed the policy of promoting civic education in the &apos; white paper on the further development of representative government &apos; .
will government inform this council what financial resources have been or will be provided to enable a smooth and effective implementation of such policy ?
secretary for district administration : - sir , existing resources have been deployed by government to promote civic education . for instance , in education , resources have been deployed in staff training and production of relevant teaching modules and education television programme on civic education .
funds have also been allocated by central government and d.b.s to organise publicity campaigns to promote civic awareness and responsibility at all levels .
promotion of civic education is a continuous exercise .
in stepping-up our efforts now with a view to reaping even more positive results in future , support ( including financial ones ) from all sectors of the community is needed . i believe that funds from within and without government would be forthcoming .
mr. szeto asked in cantonese : - ( the following is the interpretation of his question . ) according to the guideline on civic education the government has not accepted the suggestion of introducing a subject of civil education in schools but instead the government has indicated that it welcomes the introduction of such a subject by the schools themselves .
i would like the government to inform this council whether extra resources will be provided to schools that take up the initiative and provide for such a subject themselves .
secretary for district administration : - sir , with your permission i would like to consult the director of education and submit a written reply . ( annex iii )
( the following is the interpretation of her question . )
sir , will the government inform this council the details concerning staff training with regard to civic education including pre-service and in-service training ?
secretary for district administration : - likewise , sir , may i include that in my written reply .
( annex iv )
dr. ho : - sir , will adult education centres be also funded to run civic education courses for working adults as well ?
secretary for district administration : - sir , civic education is a comparatively new programme .
as i said departments concerned will continue to deploy existing resources to implement any new programme but we may have to seek new funds for such new activity and this will certainly be taken into consideration in our future submissions .
government scientist
12 . prof . poon asked : - will government inform this council whether there are plans to fill the post of government scientist ?
the chief secretary : - sir , there are no immediate plans to fill the post of government scientist , pending a fresh look at the necessity for such an appointment .
the review will cover an examination of the fundamental role of the government scientist vis-a-vis other government departments with responsibilities in this area , such as the industry department , the government laboratory , the royal observatory and the environmental protection agency .
a further consideration is whether a single individual will be able to provide advice on the many disciplines of science which are of a highly specialised nature , or whether we should rely on consultants for such advice .
prof . poon : - will the chief secretary inform this council what steps have the government taken to review this matter ?
the chief secretary : - i am looking into it at the present time , sir .
prof . poon : - sir , will the chief secretary inform this council to what extent have the recommendations in the warner &apos;s report been implemented ?
the chief secretary : - a number of the recommendations of the warner &apos;s report , apart from that on the government scientist , have been implemented and have been put into practice by the industry department on the advice of the former science adviser and now the industrial development board .
to quote a few examples , an industrial support division has been set up within the industry department to provide technical support to the development of industry , a standard calibration laboratory was opened last year and the hong kong laboratory accreditation scheme has been launched in may this year .
mr. allen lee : - i am quite surprised to hear there are no immediate plans to fill the post of government scientist .
this is of course a very important subject .
may i ask the chief secretary to consider plans for filling this post and the long-term implications that this post represents to hong kong &apos;s development ?
the chief secretary : - sir , i can &apos;t give that assurance to fill the post of a government science adviser because as i said in the answer to the principal question i am not convinced myself that the appointment of one person is the way to tackle this particular problem .
mr. lee yu-tai : - will the chief secretary inform this council whether or not previous scientific advisers perform a useful role ?
the chief secretary : - yes , sir , the previous science adviser while he was with us performed a useful role but events have moved on since then .
mr. martin lee : - sir , will the chief secretary please help us on this : why should the government establish this post even before it is considered whether or not it should be filled because it is almost as inconceivable as creating the post of governor for hong kong and then thinking about whether we should have one ?
the chief secretary : - at the time , sir , it was thought that this was a good way to skin this particular cat ( laughter ) but in the process of looking at candidates who had applied for the post and what indeed they had to say about the work of such person caused us to think again .
government business first reading of bills
chit-fund businesses ( prohibition ) ( amendment ) bill 1985
matrimonial causes ( amendment ) bill 1985
buildings ( amendment ) ( no . 2 ) bill 1985
bills read the first time and ordered to be set down for second reading pursuant to standing order 41 ( 3 ) .
second reading of bills
chit-fund businesses ( prohibition ) ( amendment ) bill 1985
the financial secretary moved the second reading of : - &apos; a bill to amend the chit-fund businesses ( prohibition ) ordinance &apos; .
he said : - sir , it would be fitting to mark this first normal meeting of the new legislative council in our new chamber with the introduction of a new bill of significance . alas , after protracted labour pains i can offer you only a ridiculous mouse .
i humbly move that the chit-fund businesses ( prohibition ) ( amendment ) bill 1985 be read a second time .
the main objective of the bill is to increase the monetary limit imposed on private chit- funds from $ 10,000 to $ 20,000 .
the operation of commercial chit-fund companies was banned by the enactment of the chit-fund businesses ( prohibition ) ordinance in 1972 .
but given the long tradition and popularity of private chit-funds , they were allowed to continue to be lawfully operated provided they meet four conditions , namely , that .
( a ) there are not more than 30 participants ; ( b ) the operator is not at the same time operating another chit fund ; ( c ) the common fund put up for sale or payment to the participants does not exceed 10,000 dollars ; and ( d ) no benefit accrues to the operator other than a right to receive the first subscription free of interest .
these legitimate private chit-funds have been relatively well regulated since the enactment of the ordinance .
but in order to ensure the law remains realistic and workable as it was when enacted , it is proposed that the monetary limit on the common fund be increased in line with inflation , from $ 10,000 to $ 20,000 .
the other conditions remain unchanged .
to simplify the procedure for amending the monetary limit in future , the bill further provides that the limit can be changed by resolution of the legislative council .
the bill also proposes to raise fines for certain offences under the principal ordinance from $ 10,000 to $ 20,000 .
finally provisions dealing with time expired transitional arrangements will be repealed .
sir , i move that the debate on this motion be adjourned .
motion made . that the debate on the second reading of the bill be adjourned - the financial secretary . question put and agreed to .
matrimonial causes ( amendment ) bill 1985
the attorney general moved the second reading of : - &apos; a bill to amend the matrimonial causes ordinance &apos; .
he said : - sir , i move that the matrimonial causes ( amendment ) bill 1985 be read the second time .
and i can assure my friend the financial secretary that he can rest assured that this measure will not over-trump his modest bid for a place in the history books .
sir , the matrimonial causes rules deal with proceedings not only under the matrimonial causes ordinance but also under the matrimonial proceedings and property ordinance .
in 1982 the chief justice made the matrimonial causes ( amendment ) rules 1982 . these rules were stated to be made in exercise of his powers under the matrimonial causes ordinance .
doubt has arisen whether the chief justice was also exercising his power under the matrimonial proceedings and property ordinance .
the purpose of this minor bill is to remove that doubt and to declare that the matrimonial causes ( amendment ) rules 1982 were made by the chief justice using his powers under both section 54 of the matrimonial causes ordinance and section 32 of the matrimonial proceedings and property ordinance .
sir , i move that the debate on this motion be adjourned .
motion made . that the debate on the second reading of the bill be adjourned - the attorney general . question put and agreed to .
buildings ( amendment ) ( no . 2 ) bill 1985
the secretary for lands and works moved the second reading of : - &apos; a bill to amend the buildings ordinance &apos; .
he said : - sir , i move that the buildings ( amendment ) ( no. 2 ) bill 1985 be read a second time .
this bill seeks to amend section 2 ( 2 ) of the buildings ordinance to extend the director of building development &apos;s power of delegation to any public officer .
under section 2 ( 2 ) of the buildings ordinance the director of public works was empowered to delegate any duties imposed on or powers granted to the building authority to any office of the public works department .
on defederalisation of the public works department in 1982 , section 2 ( 2 ) of the buildings ordinance was amended transferring this power of delegation to the director of building development and thence to officers within the building development department .
prior to defederalisation , powers under certain sections of the buildings ordinance and regulations had been delegated to officers of the highways office .
all these delegations include the recovery of costs of work carried out by the building authority .
as these officers are now within the engineering development department , the current delegation which should be restricted to the building development department is no longer valid .
in addition , some project managers of the new territories development department have been delegated with powers to act on behalf of the building authority .
assistance of other departments is still required for the administration of the buildings ordinance .
the deficiency in the power of the director of building development to delegate outside the building development department therefore needs to be rectified .
clause 2 of the bill amends section 2 ( 2 ) of the buildings ordinance to permit the director of building development to delegate to any public officer . clause 3 of the bill validates the delegations made to public officers other than those in the building development department .
sir , i move that the debate be now adjourned . motion made .
that the debate on the second reading of the bill be adjourned - secretary for lands and works question put and agreed to .
adjournment and next sitting his excellency the president : - in accordance with standing orders i now adjourn the council until 2.30 p.m. on wednesday , 13 november 1985 .
adjourned accordingly at twenty-five minutes past three o &apos;clock .
written answers
annex i
written answer by the attorney general to mr. yeung po-kwan &apos;s supplementary question to question no. 8 .
i agree that labour inspectors should give priority to inspection of those work places where illegal immigrants are more likely to find employment . this is in fact one of the labour department &apos;s priorities in preparing inspection schedules of labour inspectors and the schedules are kept under constant review with this priority in mind .
annex ii
written answer by the financial secretary to mr. david lee &apos;s supplementary question to question no. 9 .
new boards of the hang lung bank and the overseas trust bank ( and its subsidiary h.i.c.b. ) were appointed after their takeover by the exchange fund .
this has had no effect on government &apos;s general revenue or consolidated accounts .
the chairman in each case is the secretary for monetary affairs .
it is the government &apos;s intention to bring these banks as soon as possible into a condition in which they can be returned to the private sector .
in the course of achieving this each of these banks will have cost the exchange fund considerable sums .
it is therefore to everyone &apos;s advantage that they should be sold for as high a price as possible when the time is right .
consequently my instructions to the chairman in each case are to clear up the bank and to operate it in accordance with commercial policies with a view to selling it as soon as possible .
let me add that the senior management of hang lung and o.t.b. has been provided by the hongkong &amp; shanghai bank on a non-profit basis and i would like to thank them for sparing experienced staff to this end .
annex iii
written answer by the secretary for district administration to mr. szeto wah &apos;s supplementary question to question no. 11 the guidelines issued by the curriculum development committee show how a comprehensive programme of civic education can be implemented in schools , using existing resources .
however , given hong kong &apos;s changing situation , written answers - continued it is obviously important that civic education programmes should be kept relevant and up-to- date . teachers will of course be expected to show initiative in this respect by taking an intelligent and lively interest in events as they unfold , obtaining information from the press , radio and television .
nevertheless , it is recognized that teachers will need to supplement and enrich their own direct observations from time to time through ready access to relevant material .
it is planned to meet this need by setting up a resource centre which will provide teachers with a central reference , information and advice service on all matters relating to the teaching of civic education .
it is thus unnecessary for additional resources , over and above those already provided and planned , to be made available to schools choosing to offer civic education as a separate subject .
in this connection , you may recall that additional teachers have already been provided to all standard secondary schools to enable them to strengthen various important services , including the provision of extra-curricular activities , which , as you know , are an important vehicle for civic education activities .
moreover , since the inclusion of civic education as a separate subject would entail a reduction in the time devoted to other subjects , schools choosing this approach to civic education would be expected to obtain the teachers required by a deployment of their existing staff in related areas of the curriculum , such as social studies or economic and public affairs .
annex iv
written answer by the secretary for district administration to mrs. ng &apos;s supplementary question to question no. 11 .
a civic education co-ordinating committee has been set up in each college of education to ensure that the students are properly trained to implement the guidelines on civic education effectively .
there is also a joint colleges civic education co-ordinating committee to co- ordinate the formulation of a cohesive programme of training for students .
the students are trained through the formal and informal curricula , and through extra- curricular activities . apart from being trained in the methods and techniques of highlighting civic education elements in a subject and reinforcing them in a lesson , the students attend enrichment programmes which have public issues as their main themes .
they also participate in community services and other extra-curricular activities conducive to the development of civic mindedness .
the same general approach is adopted for students attending pre-service and in-service courses in the colleges .
however , due to limitations of time , the emphasis is necessarily more on activities related to the formal curriculum for part-time in-service students .
enrichment programmes in the colleges take the form of lectures , seminars , group projects , small study-groups , visits , film-shows , etc . they may be about law , economics , consumer education , public housing , etc. and are aimed at increasing social awareness .
these programmes form part of the formal curriculum .
as far as the schools are concerned , you may wish to know that since the publication of the guidelines on civic education in august 1985 , over 1 500 teachers have attended seminars and workshops arranged by the advisory inspectorate .
more of these will be organized in the coming months .

papers
oral answers to questions private secondary schools 1 . mr. lee yu-tai asked : - what is the government &apos;s policy towards private secondary schools with regard to their present role in the education system and future survival ?
secretary for education and manpower : - sir , i assume that this question refers mainly to the private independent schools which have been in the headlines recently , and not to the private- non-profit making schools from which we also buy places .
the 1978 white paper on the development of senior secondary and tertiary education stated that : &apos; the government will not extend the bought-place scheme to senior secondary forms in private independent schools and will terminate the buying of junior secondary places in schools of this type which do not have good facilities and operating standards &apos; .
this also means , of course , that there will be a number of private independent schools in which the government will no longer be buying places and , as members know , the process of phasing out the buying of places in these schools is already in hand , to commence in september 1986 .
the long-term future of private independent schools is not simply a question of the number of places bought by government , however . this must obviously be determined by the ability of these schools to provide an education service of a nature or of a quality which parents are willing and able to afford .
i have no doubt that there will always be a market for the services provided by the best of the private schools and the continued existence of such schools within a diverse education system will be welcomed by government .
the private non-profit-making schools. to which i referred earlier , will continue to provide bought places as at present and no change is expected in the foreseeable future .
mr. lee yu-tai : - sir , a working group on private schools was formed in july this year .
can this council be informed whether or not this working group plays a useful role or should it be reorganised with a revised set of terms of reference so as to contribute to policy-making for the long term future ?
secretary for education and manpower : - sir , this working party was set up under the auspices of the private schools advisory council and i think i am right in saying that they were asked to report within a period of six months , which by my calculation should be up in about january or february .
i think they have a useful role to play because it &apos;s essential that we see what can be done to help some of the less satisfactory private schools to upgrade their facilities so that they would be acceptable .
mr. szeto wah asked in cantonese : - ( the following is the interpretation of his question . )
sir , people operating private secondary schools are not really satisfied with the present policy in this particular respect ; could this council be informed whether , apart from the government and the private school operators , there can be independent third parties taking part in the review of the policy ?
secretary for education and manpower : - sir , as i said this working party has already been set up with terms of reference and membership .
i think until their report is known it will be difficult at this stage to judge exactly what further might be needed for consulting other interests .
dr. daniel tse asked in cantonese : - ( the following is the interpretation of his question . ) sir , as far as i know , the fees of the private schools are controlled by the government . and at the moment , they are set at a level much lower than that of aided schools .
does the government have a plan to allow them to raise this level to that of the aided schools so that private schools can improve their facilities and also have better staff with better qualifications so that in buying places from them the government will really be paying a fair price ?
secretary for education and manpower : - the answer to the first part of the question , that is , the factual part , is yes , that is correct .
i entirely take dr. tse &apos;s point , but in the terms of reference of the working group to which we have been referring is included the term to review the general issue of fee levels and i would certainly regard it as within the purview of that working party or in the consideration of its report , that this aspect of the matter could be further investigated and pursued .
secretary for education and manpower : - sir , this was a very tragic accident .
the construction industry training centres have had a very good record in industrial safety and there has been no serious accident at these centres in the past .
indeed , this and other training centres take care to include the teaching of good safety practice as part of their curricula .
officers of the labour department and the staff of the centre themselves are now investigating this particular accident and , in the light of their findings , the construction industry training authority will review the safety measures in these training centres with a view to doing all possible to prevent recurrence of such an accident .
the commissioner for labour is a member of the authority and will thus be in a position to ensure that the review is comprehensive and that any necessary improvements are made .
mr. yeung po-kwan : - sir , how long will the labour department take to complete investigation of this particular accident and what assurance can be give ? that good safety practice being taught as part of the curricula in the training centres will be complied with accordingly in future ?
secretary for education and manpower : - sir , i think the investigation will be completed in a comparatively short time , by that i mean a week or two from now , but i think members should bear in mind that there could be an inquest also in this case .
as for compliance with safety measures and requirements , of the curricula i think we must look to the discipline , morale and good teaching and training methods of the staff themselves .
i was very impressed on my visits to the centre by their dedication to their work and i think that we can rely on this to reduce as far as possible this type of accident .
mr. swaine : - does the employees &apos; compensation ordinance apply to a case such as this ?
secretary for education and manpower : - i think i should perhaps correct initially the impression that may have been given understandably by media reports that the person concerned was an apprentice .
this was not technicially the case : he wasn &apos;t on an apprentice contract , he was a trainee at the school . therefore , the position is that he was not an employed person and the employees &apos; compensation ordinance does not apply .
however , the authority , before it took in its first trainees , realise the potentiality of such a problem and they are in fact , as i understand it , insured to the equivalent sum that would have been payable under the employees &apos; compensation ordinance had the person concerned been an employee .
professor poon : - will the government inform this council if there are plans of the government to impose general safety regulations in this training centre as well as in factories and to ensure that these regulations are followed ?
secretary for education and manpower : - i am sorry , i am not quite sure there that question came from but the answer is in fact the training centres are not factory or industrial undertakings as defined in the ordinance .
although we have looked at this problem from time to time , on the whole we feel the operation of training centres and educational institutions is so different from that of a factory or industrial undertaking operating for profit that it is better to rely on self-regulation . standardisation of deeds of mutual covenant
3 . mr. jackie chan asked in cantonese : - ( the following is the translation of his question . ) as the real estate market is becoming more active , will government inform this council whether there are plans to draw up a standard deed of mutual covenant , in both chinese and english , for newly constructed buildings , so that consumers may understand clearly its contents , the rights which they would enjoy and their responsibilities ?
secretary for district administration : - sir , the government does not have plans to introduce a standard deed of mutual covenant . this is because a standardised deed will not be sufficiently flexible to cater for the many and varied circumstances for different kinds of building development .
however , after extensive consultations with all district boards and various related professional bodies , a number of &apos; standard clauses &apos; are being drawn up , instead , for inclusion in deeds of mutual covenant .
it is intended that as a first step , starting from early next year , deeds arising from new non-industrial leasehold grants will be required to contain these clauses .
the purpose of these clauses is to provide protection for individual buyers in several fundamental areas relating to building management and common areas , as well as to provide a clear frame-work for effective management of the building .
they also set out clearly the relationship , rights , and responsibilities of developers , management agents and individual owners with respect to the day-to-day management of property .
at present , the deeds of mutual covenant are prepared in english . when chinese versions are available , there should be no difficulty in including these standard clauses in chinese .
mr. kim cham : - sir , when will the standard clauses be implemented and when will a chinese version be ready ?
secretary for district administration : - sir , as i have said , it is intended as a first step , starting from early next year , deeds arising from new non-industrial leasehold grants will be required to contain these clauses .
as for the availability of the chinese version most if not all of the deeds are actually prepared by members of the law society and this i am sure will be done as soon as these clauses are put to them by the registrar general .
mr. martin lee : - has the law society been actually consulted on this and is it envisaged that these clauses if implemented would be required to be contained in future deeds of mutual covenant by law or some other means ?
secretary for district administration : - the standard clauses are at present being drafted by the registrar general &apos;s department .
when they are ready , the legal profession will be consulted and at the present moment , it is the intention that in future inclusion of the standard clauses will be required for all new leaseholds of non-industrial buildings .
mr. lee yu-tai : - sir , may i refer to paragraph 1 of the answer and request the secretary for district administration to inform this council whether or not government is completely satisfied with the present situation and how about deeds of covenant for old buildings ?
secretary for district administration : - sir , deeds of mutual covenant are contracts between consenting parties and some form of retrospective legislation will be required if it is to apply to the existing deeds of mutual covenant . it involves a great deal of work and therefore as a start , intention is to start on a new leasehold of non-industrial buildings .
4 . dr. ho asked : - will the government inform this council of the number of arson cases in the last three years and what measures are being taken to combat this crime ?
the attorney general : - sir , in the last three years ending september 1985 , 978 fires which were suspected by the fire services department to have been started deliberately were referred to the police for investigation .
of these , the police consider that 588 were the result of arson ( which is the deliberate setting on fire of property ) .
government considers that the most effective deterrence to arson is the successful detection and prosecution of offenders .
fire services personnel fighting fires are under instruction to investigate the cause of the fires .
if necessary , they can call out the fire services department investigation teams .
the fire services department operates training programmes for fire service officers on how to detect evidence of arson and in 1983 the programme was strengthened when courses for selected officers conducted by an arson investigation specialist were introduced .
so far , 150 fire officers have undergone this specialist training .
if , as a result of their investigations , fire services department has any suspicion the fire was caused by arson , they pass the case to the police for investigation .
in their investigations , the police are backed by the fire investigation ordinance ( chapter 12 ) which empowers the commissioner of police to take possession of any premises on which a fire has taken place or where an attempt is suspected .
where possession has been taken by the commissioner of any premises , the commissioner is requited to make a report to a magistrate as to the origin and circumstances of the fire .
on receipt of this report the magistrate must investigate the causes of the fire , unless he considers an inquiry unnecessary .
so the fact that there are these special provisions for investigating the causes of fire indicate how seriously the government takes arson .
dr. ho : - sir , what is the average level of penalty meted out to the convicted arson offenders ?
is the penalty sufficient to deter this criminal activity ?
the attorney general : - sir , the courts hand down sentences at levels commensurate with the circumstances of individual cases .
the most serious cases are prosecuted in the high court and sentences in high court cases over the last three years up to october 1985 ranged from one to 12 years &apos; imprisonment .
so far as the setting of penalty is concerned , the maximum penalty for the offence of arson under the crimes ordinance is imprisonment for life .
this maximum penalty is provided of course to cater for the very worst case and as such members may think it provides an adequate deterrence .
mrs. chow : - sir , of the 588 cases mentioned in paragraph 1 how many prosecutions have been brought by the police and how many of them have been successful ?
the attorney general : - sir , i cannot produce those particular figures at this moment and i would have to undertake to write to my honourable friend with those details . ( annex i ) control of private homes for the aged 5 .
mr. hui yin-fat asked : - in the light of the recent tragedy at a home for the aged in causeway bay , will government consider enacting legislation setting out the basic minimum standards on safety , hygiene , accommodation and staff ratio and qualification governing the operation of private old age homes in hong kong ?
the social welfare department is now consulting other government departments and will take into account experience in other countries before making proposals on the most suitable form of control .
in the meantime the department will continue to pay liaison visits to these homes to offer advice and assistance to the operators and residents where necessary .
the department is now also preparing a code of practice to provide guidance on how these homes should be run .
mr. hui yin-fat : - sir , in order to prevent further tragedies , could the government inform this council firstly when the code of practice will be ready and secondly what action the government will take if such a code of practice is not followed ?
secretary for health and welfare : - sir , i would hope that the code of practice should be ready within about three months .
in the event that the voluntary code was not followed this would be a very strong argument for enacting legislation to control private homes for the elderly and we would proceed with that as speedily as possible .
dr. ip : - sir , are all old age homes in hong kong registered with the social welfare department ?
if not , does the government not consider this to be administratively a first step towards introducing a code of practice ?
secretary for health and welfare : - sir , there is no legislation that requires the registration of old age homes and private old age homes are therefore not formally registered , although the social welfare department has done considerable research and does have what is believed to be a comprehensive list of these homes .
mr. yeung po-kwan : - sir , why was the code of practice not provided at on initial stage to operators of the private homes for the elderly for their guidance ?
secretary for health and welfare : - sir , the development of private homes for the elderly is a very recent occurrence on any scale , and it is only in the last year or so that this problem has really come to be recognised as a significant one .
mrs. fan : - sir , when paying liaison visits to these homes and offering advice and assistance to the operators , if such advice and assistance are not taken , is there anything government can do to ensure that at least a minimum standard is satisfied ?
secretary for health and welfare : - sir , as i &apos;ve explained there is at present no legislation which specifically applies to these homes . of course if some other legislation such as the fire safety regulations which apply generally were infringed there would be action that could be taken ; otherwise it would not be possible at this stage .
working party on postgraduate medical education and training 6 . dr. chiu asked : - will the government inform this council of the progress on the formation of the working party on postgraduate medical education and training ?
secretary for health and welfare : - sir , the medical development advisory committee has recommended that a working party on postgraduate medical education and training should be established and that the chairman of the working party should be an overseas expert with considerable experience of post-graduate medical education systems .
finance committee has approved funds for the appointment of a chairman on this basis .
during the past few months vigorous efforts have been made to identify a suitable candidate for appointment .
the assistance of the british department of health and social security has been sought and inquiries are also being made in singapore and australia .
through these channels i hope that it will be possible to find an appropriately qualified person in the near future .
as soon as the chairman has been appointed it is intended to proceed with the appointment of the other members of the working party .
dr. chiu : - sir , may i ask what is the rationale of a chairman from overseas and would the government consider a local chairman if a suitable candidate from overseas cannot be found after vigorous efforts in a few months &apos; time ?
secretary for health and welfare : - sir , it was felt that the chairman ought to have close working experience of a post graduate medical education system and as a person with such experience would be very difficult to find locally it was therefore decided to recruit a chairman from overseas .
but i do take dr. chiu &apos;s point ; obviously , if we cannot find a suitable person overseas we will then consider a local candidate and decide how to obtain a necessary expertise in a different way .
if the answer is yes , what are they ?
secretary for health and welfare : - sir , the m.d.a.c. has already advised on this and all the parties mentioned by dr. ip will be represented .
i can &apos;t recall the exact numbers of each but i will let dr. ip know in writing .
( annex ii )
7 . dr. conrad lam asked in cantonese : - ( the following is the translation of his question . ) in view of complaints that patients attending the families clinics are required to speak english , will government inform this council of the percentage of non-cantonese speaking medical staff who are working in families clinics and whether the posting of non-cantonese speaking personnel to these clinics is justified ?
secretary for health and welfare : - sir , of the ten medical officers who are posted to the two families clinics five are non-cantonese speaking and five are cantonese speaking . 50 per cent of the staff is therefore non-cantonese speaking .
as there have been in the past problems in finding sufficient local officers to fill posts in the families clinics , it is considered appropriate to post non-cantonese speaking medical officers to these clinics where their inability to speak cantonese is less of a handicap than it would be in general outpatient clinics .
dr. conrad lam asked in cantonese : - ( the following is the interpretation of his question . ) sir , as civil servants and their families mostly speak cantonese will the government consider changing the practice of requiring those who are qualified for treatment in such clinics to speak english as this is very inconvenient to most of them ?
secretary for health and welfare : - sir , there are only two families clinics of the type referred to in the question . in addition to this about 54 general out-patient clinics throughout the territory are available for other civil servants and a number of these clinics operate a system whereby civil servants and their families receive priority .
the government &apos;s view is that the obligation to provide satisfactory medical treatment to civil servants is adequately provided for in this way .
mr. lee yu-tai : - sir , are doctors in families clinics assisted by nursing staff and other supporting staff who speak cantonese ?
if the answer is yes , will they be able to do some interpretation ?
secretary for healthand welfare : - yes , sir , this will be possible .
mr. richard lai : - sir , according to the answer given by the secretary for health and welfare does it mean that the government is still encountering difficulty in recruiting cantonese-speaking doctors ?
secretary for health and welfare : - sir , there is less difficulty than there used to be but there is still some problem and the medical and health department still does recruit a number of doctors from overseas to fill specific posts including those in the families clinics .
dr. ip : - sir , question is partly answered but is this problem of finding sufficient local officers to fill the posts in question a general problem which affects the medical and health department across the board or is it specifically confined to the families clinics ?
if the answer is yes , could the secretary inform us why the families clinics have this problem where as the other clinics do not ?
secretary for health and welfare : - sir , the problem is a general problem across the service although i think because of the nature of the families clinics and the patients that they treat there perhaps is a particular problem in some cases .
triad activities 8 . mrs. rosanna tam asked : - in view of the increasing triad activities , will the government inform this council :
( a ) what plan it has at present to curb this increase ; ( b ) how long it will take to implement such a plan ; and ( c ) what temporary measures are in hand to improve this situation ?
the attorney general : - the government recognises the deep concern that is being expressed in the community about triads , and the government is determined , dedicated to do its utmost to eliminate triad related crimes .
operations with triad targets have been successfully mounted by the police in past months and will continue .
firstly , they have concentrated resources on the investigation of crimes involving suspected triad members .
they are also taking measures to develop an improved intelligence capability to identify relevant crimes .
secondly , the police have sought to make it more difficult for triads to profit from their traditional activities by undertaking operations against prostitution , gambling , racketeering and intimidation .
some results have been quite striking .
last wednesday for example a special territory-wide operation was carried out by police in the new territories . this involved 1 500 policemen who were mobilised to conduct snap checks on known criminal and triad haunts .
the operation lasted only six hours but 14 000 were checked . 112 people were arrested and 25 persons were charged with offences ranging from robbery to burglary , arson and narcotic offences .
of course the police are the government &apos;s tactical arm in this fight . i am sure the council will appreciate the efforts which go into this difficult area of their work . at a strategic level , sir , the fight crime committee is responsible for co-ordinating the efforts of the police and the government &apos;s other departments .
i recall that two weeks ago , in your address at the opening of this council , you said , sir , that you had asked the fight crime committee to give a high priority to this task .
the fight crime committee has established a working group on gangs chaired by the secretary for security , to identify areas of activity by triads and gangs , to determine an overall strategy and to co-ordinate the implementation of this strategy .
the working group includes a member of this council , dr. ho kam-fai and a member of a district fight crime committee .
the working group has been holding detailed discussions with heads and senior staff of government departments , which might be affected by triad activities , to find ways in which they can assist .
as a result the group has made firm recommendations for changes in the wholesale fish markets , hawker control measures , and water and electricity supply arrangements , all aimed at thwarting triad activities .
the working group has been assisted in this work by the urban council &apos;s review of their policy on hawker control .
some departments have taken their own initiatives . for example , the housing department now undertakes the complete fitting out of family huts in temporary housing areas . this has limited the opportunities for triads in that field .
finally , the working group has considered changes in the law .
sir , this work is proceeding as a matter of urgency .
early next year , this council will receive a discussion paper upon the legislative options identified by the working group to provide greater powers to investigate and prosecute organised crime .
these will need members &apos; careful consideration .
these are all steps that the government can take . but this kind of crime is also a public responsibility .
all honourable members can play their part in assisting the government to destroy the influence and appeal of the triads , especially to the young .
people must be encouraged to report triad activities . every opportunity must be taken to show that triads are neither honourable nor glamorous bands of brothers . they are gangs of thugs and bullies .
success in the end , sir , will depend upon the community &apos;s determination to stand up to threatening behaviour and to resist contemptible rackets .
mrs. rosanna tam : - sir , may i ask how serious , based on available information , is young people &apos;s involvement in these triad activities ?
the attorney general : - sir , it &apos;s not thought to be a fact that triads are successful in recruiting school children .
there have obviously been attempts to do so but indications are that these are relatively few and far between and do not present a major problem .
teenage gangs exist and in some cases they adopt the names of triad societies for the purposes of instilling fear among rivals or potential victims .
they are not true triads , however . they do not undergo initiation rites or use the triad paraphernalia . indeed they can hardly be described as societies at all .
but as in so many cases , however , to the victim who is the subject of extortion or protection rackets this is an academic distinction . the mere use of the word &apos; triad &apos; in context of teenage gangs has the desired effect .
so indeed there is evidence of involvement of young people in triad related activities .
mr. martin lee : - sir , what does the government propose to do about the statement made by the royal hong kong police force a few years ago that the triad activities were then under control , when it is now acknowledged that that was not the true position thus resulting in a loss of precious time in the fight against triads ?
the attorney general : - sir , my answer to this council deals with the way ahead .
my learned friend is going back into the past and i have nothing to add to the statements that were made by the then chief secretary about a year ago on those matters .
miss maria tam : - sir , looking ahead , legislative options deserve time for careful consideration , will government consider in the meantime revising upward the maximum sentence applicable to triad offences or urge the judiciary to reflect the seriousness of the situation in their sentences ?
the attorney general : - sir , it is not thought that the prescribed maximum penalties are in need of urgent alteration .
it is not for me , certainly , in this council to comment upon the level of the sentences handed down by the courts .
miss dunn : - sir , is there any evidence that the public are reluctant to report triad activities because of fear of revenge by other triad members ?
if so , what steps are taken to protect the identity and safety of members of the public who are prepared to stand up to victimisation by triads ?
the attorney general : - well , sir , in serious cases the police do have a well-tried and frequently used system of witness protection and that is implemented whenever it is thought to be necessary in a serious case .
it has to be recognised that in many other less serious cases members of the public are unwilling to present themselves in court to give evidence at trials ; and many trials , indeed i can say , have to be abandoned because of the fact that witnesses cannot be found .
these are matters which i know are being carefully considered within the working group and i hope that in that area too some of the legislative options will be presented to this council early next year .
mr. hui yin-fat : - sir , in the light of increasing triad activities will the government consider reinstating the triad society division of the police force so as to strengthen the combat force against triads ?
the attorney general : - sir , there has been , i think , a little misunderstanding in the past about the triad society bureau .
this triad society bureau was amalgamated , i think about two or three years ago , with other specialist units such as the serious crimes division to form the organised and serious crimes group .
the reason was that it did not make sense organisationally to separate triads from the crimes , the organised crimes , that they committed .
i can assure members that the expertise that had been generated by the triad society bureau was not lost nor did the amalgamation lessen efforts against triads .
anti-triad intelligence is now the province of the criminal intelligence bureau and the capability in this field has improved considerably over the last few years with long term intelligence-based operations against both individuals and organisations .
so i do not accept that the organisational changes in recent years have in any way prevented the war against triads continuing .
mrs. ng asked in cantonese : - ( the following is the interpretation of her question . ) i am very glad to know that many departments have assisted in this particular field .
what has the education department done in trying to stop infiltration of such elements into schools ?
his excellency the president : - mrs. ng , i think you might put that question down to the secretary for education and manpower unless he is prepared to answer straightaway .
the attorney general : - sir , i think i can do a little on his behalf if he is willing to allow me .
there are of course also junior police call clubs in 257 secondary schools and in 103 primary schools .
the education department , indeed operating at the request of the fight crime committee , is presently working on a plan that would introduce a systematic programme of in-service training on moral education that would give schools more advice on organising guidance and counselling systems that will produce pamphlets on social services available to parents and students and which will get universities to run more part- time in-service training courses on students guidance and counselling .
the problem fundamentally with the young is to strip triads of their glamorous appeal .
indeed there is presently an advertisement which is all round hong kong of a popular film which glamorises the fraternal elements of triads and yet displays great violence and appeals to the public to come and see the link in that particular film .
it &apos;s that kind of glamorous appeal which seems to me to be the responsibility of the entire community to combat .
mr. yeung po-kwan : - sir , i think the major part of the question i wish to ask has been fully answered by the attorney general , but i &apos;d just like to ask whether there has been any indication or evidence that there is a growing involvement of triad activities in schools recently ?
the attorney general : - sir , there is no evidence of a growing activity of triads in schools recently .
on the question generally of numbers i think that the increasing public concern comes from a variety of factors , not necessarily from the number of triad activities in schools , and also comes , i think , from the fact that the police are constantly improving their knowledge of triad activities .
so my short answer to the question is there is no such evidence . adjustment of civil service salaries
will government inform this council what principles and procedures it will follow in considering this request and arriving at a decision ?
the chief secretary : - sir , the major consideration in determining civil service pay is the principle of fair comparison with remuneration for comparable employement outside the government .
this principle will apply in considering the recent request by certain non- directorate staff unions for a pay adjustment of 6.4 per cent .
the main argument for the request is that since 1981 salaries for non-directorate staff have lagged behind the private sector .
with regard to the procedure to be followed , the secretary for the civil service has written to the standing commission on civil service salaries and conditions of service seeking its assistance and advice regarding the unions &apos; request as the matter falls within the standing commission &apos;s terms of reference .
when advice is received from the standing commission , the secretary for the civil service will enter into further discussions with the staff sides of the three central consultative councils .
the conclusions then reached will be submitted to the governor in council .
mr. szeto wah asked in cantonese : - ( the following is the interpretation of his question . ) well , there must be equity and we must try and anticipate trouble too ; so could the government inform this council , when it considers an adjustment to the salaries for non- directorate staff , whether it will at the same time consider their morale ?
the chief secretary : - of course , sir .
mr. kim cham : - sir , the adjustment of directorate salaries was not based on survey or research conducted by the standing commission .
in the future would it not be more appropriate that the exercise of research or survey be done by the standing commission so that there is no need to refer one to the other ?
the chief secretary : - sir , the recent revision of directorate salaries was based on the result of an overall review of pay levels of senior management in the middle range of companies in the private sector conducted by the standing committee on directorate salaries and conditions of service under its terms of reference .
the position with regard to non-directorate staff is different . pay adjustment to their salaries is determined annually having regard to the results of a pay trend survey of the private sector conducted by the standing commission .
mr. tam yiu-chung asked in cantonese : - ( the following is the interpretation of his question . ) sir , directorate staff had a second adjustment this year and reportedly it is to make up for the inadequacy since 1981 .
if the same principle and spirit are not applied in dealing with these requests by the non-directorate staff will people feel that equity has not been applied ?
the chief secretary : - sir , the government &apos;s position on this matter is that each year &apos;s pay adjustment is treated as a separate self-contained exercise with neither pluses nor minuses carried over from a previous year .
this principle however does not rule out an overall review of salaries over a period of time to see if they are still at a realistic level in comparison with the private sector .
mrs. ng asked in cantonese : - ( the following is the interpretation of her question . ) sir , following the second adjustment of the directorate officers &apos; salaries did the government consider that this will cause a corresponding request from non-directorate staff ?
the chief secretary : - yes , sir .
i think we can say that that was expected and as i said earlier in answer to the first question , this request has now been referred to the standing commission .
registration of electrical and mechanical engineers and other professional engineers 10 . mr. cheng hon-kwan : - some two years ago , a proposal was made to government that electrical and mechanical engineers should be registered in the same way as authorised persons or structural engineers .
a working party was subsequently formed in this connection . may the council be advised of any progress in the matter and is there any way that the matter may be pursued expeditiously ?
will the working party also consider the registration of other professional engineers ?
secretary for lands and works : - sir , a working party , chaired by the director of electrical and mechanical services department and comprising representatives from the electrical and mechanical contractors &apos; association , the hong kong institution of engineers and representatives from relevant government departments was formed towards the end of 1984 to undertake an indepth study of the subject of statutory registration of engineers .
the working party has its origin in a proposal from the previous building development advisory committee ( b.d.a.c. ) which expressed a concern of the impact of the growing complexity and sophistication of the electrical and mechanical services involved in the construction industry on public safety .
the terms of reference of the working party as drawn up includes the following areas of study : - first , to investigate and consider the role and legal responsibility , in particular relating to public safety , of professional engineers and technicians engaged in electrical , mechanical and other other engineering services in buildings , engineering projects and in the construction industry .
as such , the task before the working party involves a large number of engineering disciplines and trades , and from simple technology to the latest state-of-the-art hi-tech developments .
whilst the working party has not yet reached any tangible conclusions on its deliberations , it has made progress and is moving as expeditiously forward as is possible and appropriate , having regard to the broad range of issues involved and to the need for circumspect consultation .
in answer to the question whether the working party is also considering the registration of other professional engineers , the answer is yes .
under its terms of reference , the working party is required not only to examine the existing systems of registration and the person engaged in electrical and mechanical engineering but also other engineering services in the industry .
mr. cheng hon-kwan : - sir , in expediting its deliberation has the working party actually come to the stage where appropriate departments or professional bodies have been consulted on various issues involved ?
secretary for lands and works : - sir , the industry , the profession and relevant government departments are represented in the working party .
when the working party has come to its conclusions , its report will be considered within the administration and will be passed to the land and building advisory committee for advice , in which representatives of the industry and the professions are also there .
mr. s. l. chen : - sir , when may we expect the conclusions from the working party ?
secretary for lands and works : - as indicated in my reply the tasks facing the working party are involved and i do not expect a report , and an interim report at that , until next year .
mr. f. k. hu : - sir , can the secretary for lands and works advise this council whether the working party has considered the position of those engineers who are registered under the existing system with a view to meeting the new standard ?
can these engineers continue to work as registered engineer under the new system in future ?
secretary for lands and works : - this is a question the working party will no doubt have to consider very carefully because people &apos;s practice are being involved and i am sure the working party will take that into account .
domestic crimes and disputes
( a ) what the trend is regarding domestic violence ; ( b ) what the number is of crimes occurring within families ; ( c ) what the number is of suicides which may have resulted from domestic disputes ; and ( d ) what measures government have taken to remedy the situation ?
secretary for health and welfare : - sir , by &apos; domestic violence &apos; , i presume that mrs. chow is referring to crimes which are committed within the family .
from the statistics kept by the royal hong kong police force over the past five years , no particular trend can be identified .
it will be seen from the table which members have before them ( note 1 ) that while the figures fluctuate somewhat from year to year , the number of cases of homicide and serious assaults arising from this disputes of a domestic nature , of cruelty to children and incest have remained at similar levels since 1981 .
( note 1 ) affairs or disputes disputes of a domestic nature ) ( * * this figure includes not only family disputes but also cases arising as a result of other domestic issues involving more than one family i.e. nuisances , use of commual toilets etc . )
the format in which statistics are at present kept in the coroner &apos;s court does not , i am afraid , enable us to identify the number of suicides which may have resulted from domestic disputes .
crimes occurring in the family are attributable to a wide variety of reasons , including personality problems , marital discord , financial worries , drug addiction , mental disturbance and alcoholism .
the family services centres of the social welfare department and voluntary agencies provide a range of services to assist families in difficulties .
on the preventive side , they provide counselling and organise family life education programmes .
cash assistance in the form of public assistance and special needs allowances is provided as well as a range of direct services to help such families to cope with their problems .
where necessary , temporary accommodation can be arranged for women and children affected by violence in the family ; the hong kong council of women operates a shelter for this purpose and a further centre to be operated by the social welfare department should be in operation during the next financial year .
mrs. chow : - sir , is there any assessment by the government of the proportion of unreported cases of similar nature so as to gauge the true size of the problem in order to facilitate the planning of preventive measures ?
secretary for health and welfare : - sir , this is a field which has not been explored to any great extent up to the present , but the social welfare department and voluntary agencies have started compiling statistics on cases of this sort , particularly of battered wives which are handled by the department and the agencies .
the figures so far available cover a very short period and do not enable us to identify any particular trend .
but i can assure mrs. chow it is the intention to continue to compile statistics to cover this area .
mr. yeung po-kwan : - sir , what are the statutory requirements for the establishment of such a centre and is there any difference in the running condition and standard between the centre operated by the government and a shelter operated by an outside organisation ?
secretary for health and welfare : - sir , as far as i am aware there have not been any statutory requirements for these centres and there should in fact be no significant difference between the way the two centres are run .
mr. martin lee : - sir , will the secretary for health and welfare please clarify as to whether the figures he has so kindly provided for serious assaults include cases where hen pecked husbands were battered by their stronger wives or in chinese &quot; ?
secretary for health and welfare : - the figures i understand , sir , refer to crimes resulting from disputes within the family . they do not indicate who was the aggressor in each particular circumstance .
dr. ho : - sir , in the domestic violence figures what is the percentage or number of victims who are elderly persons in the family ?
secretary for health and welfare : - sir , i am afraid i don &apos;t have that percentage to hand but i will try to find out and write to dr. ho . ( annex iii )
reduction in levy on value of construction works and quarry products under pneumoconiosis ( compensation ) ordinance 12 . mr. ho sai-chu asked in cantonese : - ( the following is the translation of his question . )
secretary for education and manpower : - sir , i can confirm that it is government &apos;s intention to introduce a resolution proposing a reduction in the rate of levy under section 36 of the pneumoconiosis compensation ordinance .
it is proposed that the rate of levy be reduced by 25 per cent i.e. from 0.2 per cent to 0.15 per cent of the value of construction works in excess of $ 1 million and of quarry products to 0.15 per cent with effect from 6 january 1986 .
i intend to introduce the necessary resolution in this council on 4 december .
secretary foreducation and manpower : - sir , i think perhaps it is a bit premature to answer that question . i think we would like to see how the newly proposed reduction works out in the first year or so .
currently as mr. ho knows the ordinance is such that it precludes the board from undertaking activities other than the compensation of victims of this disease .
statement hong kong export credit insurance corporation
secretary for trade and industry : - sir , in accordance with section 28 of the hong kong export credit insurance corporation ordinance the report and accounts of the corporation for 1984-85 are tabled today .
in 1984-85 there was healthy growth in the corporation &apos;s business .
premium income grew by about 41 per cent to $ 33.8 million and total insured exports grew by about 26 per cent to $ 5,893 million , though accounting for only about 3 per cent of hong kong &apos;s domestic exports .
europe remained the corporation &apos;s largest exposure area .
insured exports to european markets which accounted for $ 3,179 million or over 50 per cent of total insured exports , grew by 14 per cent .
insured exports to north america , which accounted for $ 1,474 million or 25 per cent of total insured exports , registered a healthy growth rate of 48 per cent .
the products covered by the corporation remained consistent with the overall pattern of our total exports , with textiles and clothing accounting for 35 per cent , radios and electronic components for 16 per cent and toys for 8 per cent .
i would like to place on record , sir , the government &apos;s appreciation of the work of the corporation &apos;s advisory board , together with that of the commissioner and staff of the corporation .
adjournment and next sitting his excellency the president : - in accordance with standing orders i now adjourn the council until 2.30 p.m. on 20 november 1985 .
adjourned accordingly at twenty-five minutes past three o &apos;clock .
written answer by the secretary for security on behalf of the attorney general to mrs. selina chow &apos;s supplementary question to question no.4. the most up-to-date statistics for a three-year period , provided by the police are :
( july-december ) ( up to end of june )
written answers - continued annex iii written answer by the secretary for health and welfare to dr. ho &apos;s supplementary question to question no.11. the number of elderly people involved in incidents of domestic violence are given below :
i have been advised by the police statistician that separate statistics on the number of elderly people assaulted were not kept before 1983 .
the figures on domestic disputes given here also include those arising from incidents involving more than one family , e.g. over the use of shared toilets and other nuisances .

oral answers to questions
( the following is the translation of his question . )
will the government inform this council what progress has been made in inducing the man in the street to use the metric system , when it is expected that the system will be fully implemented in all retail markets and whether such full implementation will result in better consumer protection ?
secretary for trade and industry : - sir , the metrication committee has since 1978 embarked on a publicity and educational programme to encourage , help and persuade all sectors of the community to adopt the metric system and use metric units . the rationale is that the international trend is towards metrication .
through the efforts of the committee , much progress has been made .
in three of the five broad target areas identified by the committee metrication has already been achieved : these are education and training , building and construction , and utilities .
progress has also been made at the retail level where metric units are now used in the labelling of prepackaged food and drinks and in a wide range of household goods and electrical appliances .
a recent survey by the committee shows that 70 per cent of clothing and fashion products have converted to the new system .
there is no denying that much remains to be done in the traditional market places , where there appears to be reluctance to going metric .
while it is the intention of the metrication committee to concentrate its efforts in this area , i am afraid it would be extremely rash of me to attempt any forecast of the likely timetable for the achievement of this goal .
in the final analysis , metrication in all retail markets will be attained when there is willingness and a desire on the part of both the retailers and the general public for this change .
to the consumer , the implementation of metrication will remove the confusion which results from different systems being used simultaneously : it should make price comparison easier .
however , to the extent that the standard unit in the hawker and market stalls is the catty there is already ease of comparison .
i suspect that the pressure for change will come through competition from the supermarkets with their prepackaged items with metric units .
mr. cheung yan-lung asked in cantonese : - ( the following is the interpretation of his question . ) sir , since the launching of the metrication programme , what is the total government expenditure in this area ; and will government adopt the &apos; weather hotline &apos; system so as to provide people with a conversion rate for the metric system over a hot line ?
secretary for trade and ndustry i : - sir , there has been a six-year programme under which the metrication committee was provided with a budget of $ 3.2 million and this was for the period from 1978 to 1984 .
in addition the metrication committee has had support from the government information services general publicity vote as well as from sponsors . over the years a total of $ 350,000 has been received from commercial sponsors .
mr. cheung may like to know that in the current year , an allocation of $ 20,000 is available in the government information services publicity vote for publicity purposes of the metrication committee .
as regards mr. cheung &apos;s very constructive suggestion of a hot line . i am afraid that there is no programme for its inclusion , but i will certainly convey this interesting suggestion to the metrication committee for consideration .
dr. daniel tse asked in cantonese : - ( the following is the interpretation of his question . ) for the weights and measures to go metric , are the chinese nomenclature of the units the same as those used in china and other countries using chinese ?
i understand that china adopts the international terms , so if the terms we use are different , would government change them so that there is standardisation of these terms in chinese ?
secretary fortrade and ndustry i : - sir , i am aware that there have been contacts between the metrication committee and the metrology authorities in china . i am sure the aim is to align ourselves with the international system .
mr. ngai : - sir , it appears that there has been little promotion recently on the &apos; go metric &apos; message through the media . i wish to know what future plans the government has in mind to sustain the momentum of the metrication campaign .
secretary for trade and industry : - sir , the metrication committee has an on-going programme for continuing the publicity for metrication and the current targets are mainly the retail sector where they are working in close co-operation with a sub-committee chaired by the executive director of the consumer council in furthering its aims .
mr. martin lee : - sir , does the secretary for trade and industry think that it is necessary first to induce members of this council to turn metric before the public could be persuaded that it is a good thing ?
secretary fortrade and industry : - i am sure we all think metric , sir .
we use decimal coinage and other things which are related to the metric system .
industrial accidents
2 . mr. yeung po-kwan asked : - in view of recent repeated occurrences of industrial accidents involving workmen falling from a height in various places in the territory , will government inform this council what measures will be adopted to prevent similar accidents ?
secretary for educationand manpower : - sir , while we do not have statistics of falls from a height as distinct from the much larger category of falls of persons under all circumstances , we do know that fatal cases are almost entirely the result of falls from a height and that around three quarters of such cases occur in the construction industry .
the total number of fatalities is declining - from 52 in 1981 to 24 in 1984 and to 19 so far this year .
the number of such accidents has been and remains a major priority of the labour department .
cases are very carefully investigated and analysed with a view to identifying causes and seeking the preventive measures required .
the department &apos;s strategy in this area is composed of three broad elements : legal enforcement , education and publicity .
as regards the legal framework , the construction sites ( safety ) regulations were amended in 1983 to make more specific provision for persons working at height .
these amendments have been vigorously enforced .
of 492 prosecutions in 1984 for breaches of construction sites regulations , 282 cases were in this particular area .
meanwhile , the labour department &apos;s industrial safety training centre conducts safety courses specifically tailored to the needs of the construction industry and also assist other organisations in running similar courses .
the department itself ran 40 courses last year , attended by some 850 people .
publicity is the third major weapon .
in recent years , the labour department - in conjunction with the labour advisory board &apos;s committee on industrial safety and accident prevention and other organisations - has conducted an intensive publicity campaign aimed at promoting good safety practices and instilling a sense of safety-consciousness at work .
safety in the construction industry has featured prominently in this effort .
action of the kind i have described will continue to be taken and i trust that this will contribute to a further decline in fatalities caused by this type of accident .
mr. yeung po-kwan : - sir , in the light of the amendment made in the construction site ( safety ) regulations in 1983 to make more specific provisions for persons working at height , does the government make enough provision of manpower to ensure that the amended regulations are effectively and efficiently enforced ?
secretary for education and manpower : - yes , sir , i should perhaps make clear that although the amendments to the construction site ( safety ) regulations were actually made in 1983 , they were based on a safe practice code which was drawn up with the building contractors &apos; association and others , so in fact the operation of the type of safety measures go back considerably before the amendments were brought in .
as regards the question of manpower , i think in most safety matters all departments could probably do with more than they actually have , but i am satisfied that within the resources available the factory inspectorate is doing a good job in this area .
mr. lee yu-tai : - sir , will the secretary for education and manpower inform this council whether or not government considers current requirements adequate for insurance on workmen exposed to the danger of falling from great height ?
secretary for education and manpower : - it is always very difficult to be satisfied in any area of safety .
i think - and i believe the commissioner for labour would concur with this view - that at the moment the biggest defect as it were is perhaps supervision on the site and members would probably like to be aware that i am proposing to bring to this council in the next two or three months safety officers regulations to bring in safety officers and safety supervisors on construction sites .
i am sure this will make a substantial difference in the long run .
mr. chung asked in cantonese : - ( the following is the interpretation of his question . ) mr. chairman , on the actual execution , will government send labour inspectors to inspect all construction sites and i stress all construction sites .
if this is the case , could this council be informed of the frequency of such visits and how many labour inspectors there are with the special responsibility of visiting construction sites with a view to checking on the safety of workers ?
secretary for education and manpower : - it would certainly be an impossible task to have inspectors on all construction sites at all time i think and of course this is one of the reasons that safety should be built into the method of work by the construction companies and contractors .
i haven &apos;t got it with me , but i will write to mr. chung on the question of what the current frequency is .
it isn &apos;t always easy because construction sites move round a great deal and although contractors are by law required to inform the labour department of all sites it may take some time to get round to them all .
( annex i )
censorship of advertising and promotion material relating to films
3 . mrs. chow asked : - will government inform this council what procedures have been recently introduced regarding the censorship of advertising and promotion material relating to films to be shown in public ?
the chief secretary : - sir , under section 5 of the places of public entertainment ordinance ( chapter 172 ) , all posters , pictures , figures or the text of any advertisement used in connexion with any film intended for public viewing must be submitted to the film censorship authority , that is the commissioner for television and entertainment licensing , for approval .
the authority gives immediate consideration to advertising material on the spot when it is submitted .
however , it is the authority &apos;s view that this practice does not allow sufficient time properly to scrutinise all the material presented .
support for this view is evidenced by complaints about the loose standards being applied to film advertising materials , in particular those in newspapers .
the commissioner considers that he needs sufficient time for the censors properly to assess the material submitted , and where necessary , to consult members of his public advisory group .
with this in mind , a new procedure was introduced with effect from 1 november allowing two clear working days for the commissioner to approve advertising materials .
a formal record of registering the materials submitted and conveying details of the decision will be introduced .
mrs. chow : - sir , has the view of the trade been consulted regarding the new requirement of the two clear working days and will the commissioner be prepared to apply this new rule with flexibility without , of course , compromising the standard in any way , but taking into consideration difficulties likely to be encountered by the trade as a result of market conditions ?
the chief secretary : - sir , the commissioner had sounded out the practicality of the revised procedure with a number of prominent film distributors in the absence of a formal trade association of film distributors and the general response to his enquiries was not unfavourable .
the commissioner is prepared to waive the two-day requirement on application in order to meet genuine scheduling needs , but in normal circumstances , he would like two clear working days .
mr. lee yu-tai : - sir , will the chief secretary inform this council whether people in the advertising business prefer that current standards be retained or would they be prepared to take a greater degree of censor ?
the chief secretary : - sir , i am sure those in the trade would prefer standards which bring in the crowds but we have to concern ourselves with the public and what the public would like and strike a balance .
pornographic magazines
4 . mr. lee yu-tai asked : - certain actions were taken against &apos; pornographic magazines &apos; in may 1985 , after which the magazines more or less disappeared . it has been reported that the publication and sale of similar magazines have now resumed .
does the government know how the present situation compares with that before may 1985 , in terms of number of titles and sales volume ?
the chief secretary : - sir , since may this year , the government has taken firmer action to deal with the sale of publications deemed to be objectionable .
following seizures at newspaper stands in may , both publishers and vendors became more cautious about what they have published or displayed for sale , and some have even ceased or discontinued publication .
the number of titles requiring regular surveillance has decreased from 13 in may to about nine at present .
as an indication of the overall situation during april and may this year , there were 29 prosecutions , whereas over the past two months , there have only been eight .
government action to control and eliminate this objectionable trade continues .
as regards sales volume , the government does not have access to such statistics , but indirect sources indicate that the popularity of these magazines has declined .
the sales of the most popular titles is currently believed to be about 100 000 copies per issue , compared to about 200 000 copies in may .
the average circulation of the other issues is about 20 000 copies per issue .
mr. lee yu-tai : - can the chief secretary inform this council whether or not the proliferation of pornographic literature has caused any increase in sex related crimes such as indecent assaults and rapes ?
the chief secretary : - no , sir . i couldn &apos;t confirm that there is a direct correlation between these two things .
miss dunn : - what exactly does the government do , to quote the chief secretary &apos; to control and eliminate this objectionable trade &apos; ?
the chief secretary : - sir , the police , the customs and excise department and the legal department are the main government agencies for enforcing the objectionable publications ordinance .
the police special duties squads maintain regular surveillance in areas where objectionable publications are known to be on sale .
the copyright division of the customs investigation bureau carries out regular checks at various entry points into hong kong .
staff of the administrative services and information branch of the government secretariat also assist in closely monitoring the contents of registered printed publications that are delivered to the branch by local publishers as well as in performing ad hoc surveillance at potential outlets of objectionable articles .
mr. hui yin-fat : - sir , a survey conducted by the hong kong christian service lately of 4 000 f. i to f. iii students has reviewed that 40 per cent of the young students read local pornographic magazines at least once weekly .
does the government consider this serious enough to introduce some measures to discourage this trend of development which will immoralise the healthy growth of our juveniles ?
the chief secretary : - yes , sir .
a package of proposals setting out possible options for improving the control of obscene and violents publications including proposals for controlling the access and sale conditions will be considered by the executive council shortly .
mrs. fan : - sir , the government had on a number of occasions called for public assistance in reporting pornographic magazines . i wonder whether the chief secretary could tell us what kind of co-operation has the government received from members of the public on this ?
the chief secretary : - sir , i cannot say exactly the scale of the help that has been given , but i would like to say in this council that any help that can be given by organisations and associations in hong kong and by members of the public to help in the war against this sale of these objectionable articles and publications will be gladly received .
nuisance caused by pig-breeding in the urban area
5 . mr. kim cham asked : - in the urban area , some sites with pig-breeding activities are causes of environmental nuisance to nearby residents and have led to regular complaints .
what is the government &apos;s policy towards these activities ?
secretary for health and welfare : - sir , it is certainly the government &apos;s policy that pig- breeding activities which cause environmental nuisance should not be tolerated .
unfortunately , the by-laws which control the conditions under which pigs and other animals can be kept and in particular the means of disposal of animal wastes , have proved very difficult to enforce and are largely ineffective .
we are about to begin public consultation on a package of proposals for the control of animal wastes , which will include a ban on the keeping of pigs in the main urban areas .
mr. kim cham : - sir , with the present inadequacy of the by-laws would consideration be given to compensating the existing breeders , resiting them or assisting them to improve the treatment of animal waste so as to bring about a quicker solution to this very difficult problem of nuisance ?
secretary for health and welfare : - sir , the package to which i refer does include a number of options for dealing with this particularly intractable problem but the general consensus within the administration is that in the main urban areas probably the only very satisfactory solution would be a total ban on these activities .
dr. ho : - sir , how many complaints about nuisance caused by pig-breeding in urban areas were received by the government in the last three years and what measure has the government taken to remedy these complaints ?
mr. cheong-leen : - sir , does the urban areas mean hong kong island and urban kowloon ?
secretary for health and welfare : - i am not exactly sure what mr. cheong-leen is referring to , but the proposals that we are formulating cover not just the main urban areas of hong kong and kowloon but also the new towns of the new territories .
diversion of traffic from lion rock and aberdeen tunnels at peak hours
6 . mr. cheng hon-kwan asked : - in view of the traffic congestion at the lion rock tunnel and the aberdeen tunnel during the peak hours , has the government ever considered operating a warning signal at the entrance to the tunnel area as necessary to divert traffic to an alternative route before being jammed in the queue ?
secretary for transport : - sir , yes , this is something which has been considered .
however , current traffic conditions at the aberdeen tunnel are not such as to warrant the use of warning signals , and in the case of the lion rock tunnel there are practical problems which means that the use of such signals would not really help .
if signals were to be used they would have to be placed so far back from the tunnel , particularly on the sha tin side coming southbound , in order to enable drivers to take an alternative route , that they might well not reflect the actual traffic situation at the tunnel by the time a vehicle reached it .
in any case , the tai po road , which is the only alternative route to lion rock tunnel , is already being used to capacity during peak periods .
warning signals would i fear be of little use to motorists .
mr. cheng hon-kwan : - sir , i understand that provision has already been made in the elevated road sign at the southern entrance to the aberdeen tunnel area .
would the government be prepared to use it during the peak hours especially when the elevated road- way between the aberdeen tunnel and the cross-harbour tunnel is fully congested ?
secretary for transport : - yes , sir , we will consider that suggestion .
miss dunn : - sir , if warning signals are of little use , what does the government propose to do to tackle this problem ?
secretary for transport : - the problem immediately facing us in the lion rock tunnel is that the traffic volume going through the toll booths is less than the capacity of the tunnel ; so the short term step to be taken , which is being taken , is to increase the number of booths .
an additional two booths have already been built and are in operation and a further three are under construction .
this will enable something like 6 500 vehicles to go through the tunnel per hour and matches very nearly the actual capacity of the tunnel itself .
a second step to be taken is the introduction as early as possible to prepaid tickets .
there is no doubt that the three-dollar toll has slow down the throughput at the tunnel .
i have , sir , in fact provided that information in a written answer to question no. 13 by mr. andrew wong .
school children vans
7 . mr. yeung po-kwan asked : - in view of the large number of students who travel in school children vans everyday , will government inform this council :
( a ) what are the number and types of school children vans presently registered with the transport department ; ( b ) whether existing legislation governing school children vans is adequate to meet present needs ; and ( c ) what measures will government adopt to ensure that students get on and off the vans safely ?
secretary for transport : - sir , there are 1 598 van-type vehicles which are registered with the transport department as being used for school transport .
this figure is made up of 1 430 light buses which have between seven and 14 seats which have been registered as private light buses ( school service ) and 168 seven-seater vans which have been registered as private cars and issued with school hire car permits .
existing legislation governing these vehicles is considered adequate to meet present needs to the extent that it requires them to be constructed to a safe design and to be driven safely .
all vehicles used for the transport of school children must comply with the requirements prescribed in the regulations governing the construction and maintenance of vehicles whilst all drivers are required by the road traffic ordinance to exercise proper care to ensure that they do not endanger themselves , their passengers or other road users .
persons licensed to drive private light buses are required to have held a valid driving licence for a private car for at least three years and to pass a driving test for light buses .
the government does in a number of ways assist parents and operators of school vans and light buses to ensure the safety of children boarding and alighting from these vehicles .
each year the education department issues guidelines to kindergarten supervisors on the safety of children travelling in school mini-buses .
these recommend , amongst other things , that children should be supervised by a teacher or an adult other than the driver whilst travelling and that they should be taught the correct way to get off and on the bus .
in addition , the police regularly give talks to kindergartens and primary schools about road safety .
these deal mainly with the behaviour of children as pedestrians but their behaviour in vehicles is also covered .
to supplement this , the government intends to produce a leaflet for drivers of school vans and light buses , and for parents and children on the correct way to behave in these vehicles and to advise them on how to get on and off such vehicles safely .
the leaflet should be ready early next year .
mr. yeung po-kwan : - sir , despite the guidelines on safety issued by the education department each year , can the government assure the public that there is full compliance on the part of the school van operators with a recommendation that children should be supervised by a teacher or an adult other than the driver while travelling ?
secretary for transport : - sir , i would like to give a general assurance that these vehicles are properly constructed , properly maintained and that they do behave in a safe manner , generally speaking .
over 70 per cent of the vehicles , as shown by a recent survey , do have an adult supervisor in addition to the driver and i believe that the present system is very much better than the old system where vehicles were not properly maintained and properly insured .
prof . poon : - sir , i would like to make reference to the question of present needs .
there are two types of school children , one going to the normal schools and the other going to special schools .
i understand that children going to special schools , because of their need , pay an average of $ 100 more than those going to normal schools .
i believe a large number of children going to special schools come from families of insufficient means .
will government inform this council whether there are plans to subsidise the cost of the transport service for needy parents of special school pupils ?
secretary for transport : - sir , i think perhaps that question might be better answered by my colleague , the secretary for education and manpower .
i am not myself personally aware of the details of the particular question &apos;s answer .
secretary for education and manpower : - i must confess i don &apos;t have this one at my fingertips either ; but the rehabilitation development coordinating committee is currently considering a report on the transport needs of the disabled .
i will ensure this point is also looked into .
( annex ii ) dr. daniel tse : - sir , it is common knowledge that because of the small size of the children seven-seaters often serve as 14-seaters and 14-seaters often serve as 20-seaters for the small children .
would government have any specific instructions or contemplate any regulation against this type of overloading of these light buses for the children ?
secretary for transport : - yes , sir , i will take particular care to ensure that the leaflet i referred to covers this point .
mr. szeto wah asked in cantonese : - ( the following is the interpretation of his question . ) sir , since in the vicinity of many schools there are urban clearways , when the children get off they have to walk quite a long way and pass by many accident-prone areas before they get to school .
can the government inform this council how the situation can be improved to ensure children &apos;s safety ?
secretary for transport : - it would of course not be suitable for these vehicles to stop at urban clearways as this would certainly be dangerous .
the only answer is to ensure that the schools themselves whenever possible have an area off-street for the vans to go .
as for the other possibilities the only answer is to ensure that there are side streets where the vans can stop safely .
mr. martin lee : - sir , from one of the answers from the secretary for transport it is apparent that 30 per cent of the operators of these vans do not follow the guideline requiring someone to supervise young children while travelling .
is there any reason then why this should not be obligatory by law ?
secretary for transport : - mr. lee is quite right , this is not a legal requirement although i believe the voluntary requirement has been followed increasingly , as i said , over 75 per cent , and the number is rising .
many of these vans have only seven or 14 seats and the economics of them are such if they were required to pay for a full-time supervisor , it might put them out of business and i &apos;d like to assure this council that this present system is working well and i do not want to take the risk of upsetting it .
employment of social work graduates
does the government have any plans , like the one intelligently implemented last september to improve the quality of education in government and aided schools by the provision of additional teachers due to available manpower , to place these fresh social work graduates in relevant gainful employment ?
secretary for health and welfare : - sir , improvements to social welfare services , like all other projects in the public sector , depend upon the availability both of manpower resources and of funds .
it is for these reasons that the proposed improvements in the manning ratio for school social work , which have figured in the five year plan since 1982 have not yet been implemented .
for the current financial year , on the advice of the subvention and lotteries fund advisory committee , it has been decided that new projects and expansion of services should be accorded a higher priority than improvements to existing services .
mr. hui informs us that 28 of this year &apos;s social work graduates were still unemployed last month .
i do not know whether these graduates still hope to get jobs in the public sector of social services or elsewhere .
in any case , the government cannot guarantee to find employment for all graduates in any subject although the universities do of course take into account the demand and supply situation when planning their enrolment .
i understand from the secretary for education and manpower that the scheme for providing additional teachers which was implemented last september was part of a longer-term project begun in 1981 to improve the quality of education in government and aided schools in stages .
it was not devised with the sole object of absorbing the graduates of the colleges of education .
mr. hui yin-fat : - sir , the hong kong council of social service survey showed that the projected employment situation for social work graduates of 1986 , that is next year , will be worse , with supply of over 400 graduates , out stripping demand of 200 vacancies by over 100 per cent .
would the government consider terminating its training scheme for general degree holders implemented in 1983 as a temporary measure to resolve the social work manpower shortage in order to maximise the use of available resources ?
at the same time would the government review existing manning ratio in various social services in order to absorb qualified people into the workforce ?
secretary for health and welfare : - sir , the scheme to recruit graduates in subjects other than social work was introduced , as mr. hui said , about two years ago .
it was always an intention that this should be a temporary arrangement and that it would be reviewed in the light of the manpower situation at the time and i think i can give an assurance that this will be done .
mr. sezto wah asked in cantonese : - ( the following is the interpretation of his question . ) sir , can the government inform this council when the change of the manning ratio of social workers in schools from 1 : 4 000 to 1 : 2 000 will be achieved ?
secretary for health and welfare : - sir , i am afraid i can give no firm assurance of when this will be achieved .
as i said in the earlier answer it depends both on the manpower situation , which mr. hui assures us is improving , and on the financial situation .
placement of the disabled in full-time employment
9 . dr. ho asked : - is the government satisfied with its service with regard to the placing of disabled persons in full-time employment , and are there any plans to expedite placement of the disabled ?
secretary for education and manpower : - sir , the government agency concerned is the selective placement service which was established within the labour department in july 1980 with the objective of providing job placement assistance to blind , deaf and otherwise physically handicapped persons seeking employment .
up to september of this year , the s.p.s. has registered or re-registered some 8 000 job-seekers and has made 3 300 placements , a placement rate of approximately 41 per cent .
the service was extended to the mentally handicapped in july 1984 .
at present , the tsuen wan office is attending to persons who are mentally handicapped while the ngau tau kok office looks after the physically handicapped and the hong kong office offers service to both the mentally handicapped and the physically disabled .
plans are in hand to open up the former two offices to both categories so that all three offices of the selective placement service will provide a comprehensive service to disabled persons .
placement officers of the s.p.s. make regular visits to employers both to explain to them the working ability of the disabled and to identify jobs which are suitable for disabled persons .
the service has also produced five pamphlets , dealing with different kinds of disability to advise prospective employers on how to cope with disabled employees .
appeals to employers to take on disabled workers are regularly made through the use of television announcements of public interests and liaison is also maintained with major employers &apos; associations .
to summarise , sir the problem of placing the disabled is being tackled and i think it is fair to say to good effect .
we shall nevertheless be looking out for ways to improve this service further .
dr. ho : - sir , what monetary incentives does the government provide to the employers who are willing to employ disabled persons and how much has the government spent in the last three years as incentives and how many disabled persons have been placed under such scheme ?
secretary for education and manpower : - sir , i think dr. ho referred to monetary incentives though there are no direct monetary incentives as such , although of course we do , in conjunction with employers associations , honour employers who make special efforts in employing the disabled .
prof . poon : - sir , has the government any plans to increase the annual intake of disabled persons in full-time employment since it is the biggest employer in hong kong ?
secretary for education and manpower : - that question , sir , should of course be addressed to the chief secretary .
however i will manfully try on his behalf since it is civil service employment .
the government recognises the need to take a lead in placing the disabled in appropriate jobs in the civil service wherever possible .
as at 1 april 1985 there were 1 966 disabled officers working in a wide variety of jobs in the civil service .
the number of disabled persons newly recruited each year has been increasing from 70 in 1980 to 189 in 1983 . the number dropped to 169 in 1984 and so far this year 97 has been placed .
this drop is largely the result of the financial restraint placed on civil service growth .
the selective placement service and the civil service branch are concurrently conducting a series of visits to departments with a view to identifying more job opportunities to the disabled in the civil service .
blackmail by adulterating soft-drinks
10 . mr. richard lai asked : - in view of the potential danger to the public , would the government explain why in the recent incident involving the poisoning of soft drinks on sale in a local supermarket , no announcement was given to the matter until after the suspects had been arrested ?
the attorney general : - sir , i understand that this question refers to two amateurish attempts in the last year to extort money from a soft drink manufacturer .
in the first blackmail attempt , eight bottles of soft drink on sale in a local supermarket were affected with nothing more than pinholes .
the second attempt did involve the discovery of 12 bottles of adulterated soft drinks - but the police were quickly able to establish that the amounts of poison introduced were so minute that even if drunk by a child , it would only have caused mild reactions .
had the danger to the public been more serious , a warning would certainly have been given .
but careful consideration led the police to conclude , on reasonable grounds , that this was not necessary .
the police were quickly able to establish a link between the two attempts , the lack of sophistication of the culprits , the fact that the affected drinks appeared to be in one location , and , most important of all , the minimal quantities of adulterant found .
in these circumstances , it was judged that premature publicity would only have played into the hands of the culprits by creating unnecessary public alarm and improving the chances of a successful extortion .
finally , sir , i would add that world experience shows a distressing tendency for imitative or &apos; copycat &apos; crimes to result from the publicity given to cases of this sort .
accordingly , the less publicity the better where there is no significant threat to public health .
mr. richard lai : - sir , can the government inform this council of the time lag between the first and the second attempt ?
the attorney general : - sir , the first incident took place on 26 november 1984 and the second demand relating to the second incident on 28 february 1985 .
abuse of the aged
11 . dr. conrad lam asked in cantonese : - ( the following is the translation of his question . ) can the government inform this council of the number of cases of maltreatment of elderly persons during the past three years , and what measures are being taken to improve the situation ?
secretary for health and welfare : - sir , abuse of the elderly can take many forms , including physical abuse , psychological abuse , and various forms of neglect .
the family welfare case records do not include a specific category which covers these types of case , but a recent study identified a total of 277 cases being handled by the social welfare department , the welfare agencies and the subvented hospitals in late 1983 .
this does not indicate that abuse of the elderly is a major problem area .
the government &apos;s overall policy for the welfare of the elderly is to encourage them to remain in the community as long as possible , preferably within the family or a familiar environment .
public assistance and the old age allowance enable many elderly people to maintain a degree of financial independence , which helps to avoid one of the main causes of friction within the family .
the family life education programme also places considerable emphasis on respect for the elderly and the need to improve relationships between the generations .
in addition a variety of other services for the elderly are provided , mainly by voluntary agencies , including home help and community nursing , day centres , social centres and multi-service centres .
for elderly people who can no longer live on their own or with their families , a range of accommodation services are provided , including hostels , care-and-attention homes and special arrangements for compassionate re-housing in public housing estates .
all these services are aimed at improving the lot of the elderly , and lessening the likelihood of their being subject to abuse .
dr. conrad lam asked in chinese : - ( the following is the interpretation of his question . ) sir , when did the 277 cases mentioned in the first paragraph happen and how does this number compare with the number of cases of maltreating children ?
secretary for health and welfare : - sir , there were 277 active cases in the latter part of 1983 when the survey was conducted .
i do not have with me figures of the abuse of children , but i am sure that there are far more cases of that type than there are cases of abuse of the elderly but i will give dr. lam a note setting out the comparison .
( annex iii )
miss dunn : - sir , on the same thing , is the government satisfied that the study conducted in 1983 based on cases being handled by various agencies at that time can be taken as an indication , a realistic indication , whether or not there is a problem ?
secretary for health and welfare : - sir , we have no reason to suspect the situation has notably worsened during the last two years .
mr. hui yin-fat : - sir , will the government consider co-ordinating among its departments , voluntary agencies and professional groups concerned to work out a guideline to identify , assist and protect the abused elderly just as the ones established for child abuse cases ?
secretary for health and welfare : - sir , i agree with mr. hui that it would be worthwhile conducting a similar exercise to the one we did on abused children a little while ago .
i propose to undertake this .
appointment of inspectors into the affairs of the carrian group of companies
12 . mr. david li asked : - would the government inform this council why the inspectors into the affairs of the carrian group of companies were appointed under the powers contained in the securities ordinance and not those of the companies ordinance ?
the financial secretary : - sir , the first factor is the appointment of inspectors to investigate the affairs of eda investments limited and its subsidiaries and associated companies on 8 march 1983 .
prior to that appointment , both the securities commission and the administration carefully considered whether the investigation should be conducted under the aegis of the securities ordinance or the companies ordinance .
the arguments were finely balanced ; but the conclusion was that an investigation under section 127 of the securities ordinance was preferable . the ordinance directly governs the area that was that of greatest concern to the public. i.e. dealings in securities . it also gives greater flexibility and wider powers .
a need to appoint inspectors to investigate the affairs of the carrian group of companies became apparent in april 1983 .
because the investigation into eda had shown a high degree of interaction between eda and the carrian group of companies and between certain individuals , the securities commission and the administration both agreed that for speed of enquiry and the general benefit to be derived from it , the same inspectors should be appointed under the same legislation .
mr. lee yu-tai : - sir , surely given the power of inspectors under the companies ordinance to make interim reports which would be available to the prosecution would it have been more prudent to appoint them under the companies ordinance ?
the financial secretary : - sir , that there is specific power under the companies ordinance to make interim reports does not mean to say that interim reports cannot be given by the inspectors appointed under the securities ordinance .
in fact this is exactly what has happened and there have been a series of interim reports . the problem is not actually with the reports ; it is that we cannot make the reports available to the prosecution because of undertakings given by the inspectors with the consent of the securities commission to the accused in the carrian trial in order that they would give evidence to the inspectors before the conclusion of that trial .
mr. david li : - sir , in view of the high cost of the inspectors appointed and the fact that their investigation is often a duplication of that of other investigative departments and of a limited use , would the government consider amending the securities ordinance and the companies ordinance to give the inspectors appointed thereunder greater power ?
the financial secretary : - once the report of the inspectors is available to the securities commission which is a distinguished body of citizens and under the chairmanship of a retired judge of the court of appeal , they will of course see if there are any messages to be learnt from the inspectors &apos; conclusions and they will so advise the government .
written answer to question regulation of traffic flow through lion rock tunnel
( a ) whether it intends to temporarily dispense with tunnel charges at the lion rock tunnel , if so , when ?
if not , why not ? and ( b ) or alternatively whether it intends to introduce a prepaid ticket system to increase the traffic flow through the existing booths , if so , when ?
if not , why not ?
secretary for transport : - it is not intended temporarily to dispense with tunnel charges at the lion rock tunnel pending completion of the additional three toll booths now under construction .
as regards the question about prepaid tickets , the answer is &apos; yes &apos; ; it is intended to supplement the present warrant system used by large fleet operators with a prepaid ticket system available to all as soon as the arrangements for printing and selling the tickets are finalised .
statements
also tabled is a government paper in response to comments on certain policy issues in the report .
i would like briefly to explain the reasons for the government proceeding in this way .
the appropriate forum for considering policy issues. including any that may be raised in the director of audit &apos;s annual report. is this council where they can be fully and properly debated .
moreover. from a practical point of view , controlling officers who are required to appear before the public accounts committee , are rarely the officers responsible for policy , and are not therefore usually in a position to respond authoritatively on matters of policy .
sir , the report of the director of audit is a thorough and highly professional piece of work .
the point i make is out of principle regarding the procedures to be used for discussion of policy issues raised by the report ; but let me , at the same time , assure members of this council the government will answer all the points raised in the report .
air transport policy
the financial secretary : - sir , with your permission . i shall make a statement on air transport policy .
introduction for many years there has been only one active hong kong airline .
in recent months , however , we have seen the establishment of two additional airlines .
one is already operational and has mounted a number of charter services , and the other is planning to start operations at an early date .
together they have made a total of 15 licence applications to the air transport licensing authority ( a.t.l.a. ) , which are to be the subject of a public enquiry next month .
there is also a prospect of further airlines seeking to enter the air transport market shortly .
this new situation has required the government to reconsider its policy in relation to certain air services matters .
it has done so , taking into account its overall responsibility and the interests of the travelling public and shippers . it has also had to take cognizance of the highly regulated nature of the international air transport industry .
the government considers it desirable that its policy on scheduled and nonscheduled operations by hong kong airlines should be known to the public and to the airlines themselves .
scheduled services let me deal first with scheduled services .
to operate such services on any given route , an airline already holding an air operator &apos;s certificate must , as a first step , obtain the requisite licence .
it is a.t.l.a. , an independent body established under the air transport ( licensing of air services ) regulations , which determines licence applications .
its terms of reference for doing so are laid down in law in some detail , but generally speaking it must have regard to the co-ordination and development of air services with the object of ensuring the most effective service to the public while avoiding uneconomical overlapping .
an a.t.l.a. decision on a licence application is final .
the next step is for the airline ( assuming it meets the designation criteria ) to be designated under the relevant air services agreement to exercise rights on the route for which it has been licensed or , if the rights do not exist , for a decision to be taken as to whether those rights should be sought .
designation and the decision on whether to seek additional rights are matters for h.m.g. acting on the advice of the hong kong government .
where the rights exist , it is only in the most exceptional circumstances that a government can decline to accept designation of an airline .
as i mentioned earlier , international air transport is highly regulated .
air traffic rights are not available to all and sundry .
such valuable rights are jealously guarded and governments seek to retain the maximum share for their own airlines .
often there is only one international carrier , which may well be wholly or partly state-owned .
consequently , many , if not most , bilateral air services arrangements provide for only one airline to be designated by each party to operate all its routes ; others permit no more than one airline per route for each side .
in these circumstances designation of more than one hong kong airline on any route would be considered only in circumstances where it was judged that more competition was needed in the public interest and the traffic was sufficient to sustain a substantial operation by more than one hong kong airline .
at the present time however the most heavily travelled routes to and from hong kong are already well served by several established operators . the government has therefore decided that as a general rule , and subject to the existing arrangements in any given case , designation in respect of routes available to hong kong will be limited to one airline per route .
the airline first licensed by a.t.l.a. for a route will normally be the one to be designated for that route .
there are other circumstances in which the government has a role to play in designation . they are :
that briefly is the government &apos;s general policy on designation . it applies equally to all hong kong airlines .
non-scheduled services turning to non-scheduled services , under the relevant provisions of the air transport ( licensing of air services ) regulations , it is the director of civil aviation who decides whether or not to grant a permit and what conditions , appropriate to the nature and circumstances of the application , to attach to a permit .
the director of civil aviation will normally approve an application for a permit for an ad hoc , non-scheduled service , if the applicant airline holding an air operator &apos;s certificate has reasonably demonstrated that corresponding scheduled services cannot satisfy a genuine demand by providing the service or capacity requested , whether for passengers or cargo , at the price offered .
applications for non-scheduled services for the same route will be dealt with on a &apos; first come , first served &apos; basis .
of course approval by the director of civil aviation must be matched by equivalent approval by the other administration involved .
supplementary provision of just under $ 262.5 million was approved , of which $ 145.8 million were included in supplementary warrants .
some major provisions included $ 198.7 million for the payment of grants to the universities , polytechnics , baptist college and urban council as a result of the 1985 civil service pay adjustment ; $ 8.2 million for the construction of the city polytechnic premises and $ 7.3 million for reimbursement to the english schools foundation of rent allowances for former government teachers and their replacements .
it is reassuring to note that there will be no net increase in expenditure arising from the supplementary provision approved because it has been offset either by savings under the same or other heads of expenditure or by deletion of funds under the additional commitments votes .
approved commitments were increased by $ 43.5 million during this period and new commitments of $ 151.4 million were also approved .
items in this summary have been approved either by finance committee or under delegated authority .
the latter have been reported to the finance committee in accordance with section 8 ( 8 ) ( a ) of the public finance ordinance .

motions
employees &apos; compensation ordinance
the secretary for education and manpower moved the following motion : -
the levels of compensation specified under various sections of the employees &apos; compensation ordinance are , in accordance with the recommendations of a 1978 working party which reviewed the then workmen &apos;s compensation ordinance , revised every two years .
since the present levels have been in force since july 1983 , a further revision is now due .
to give insurers sufficient time to make adjustments to their rates of premium. it is proposed to bring the revised levels of compensation into force on 1 january 1986 .
it is proposed to raise the present levels of compensation by roughly 23.5 per cent .
the basis for this proposal is the 15.6 per cent increase in overall wage rates , according to the census and statistics department. between march 1983 , the date against which the present levels of compensation were set , and march 1985 .
the present levels of compensation were set on the basis of calculations made several months before their introduction which underestimated the increase in wage rates in the meantime .
allowing therefore for an adjustment to correct this under-estimation and assuming a further 5 per cent increase in overall wage rates between march 1985 and january 1986. compensation levels should be set , with effect from january 1986 . 23.5 per cent higher than at present .
a similar increase is proposed in the maximum payments to be made by an employer towards the costs of supplying and fitting a prosthesis or a surgical appliance and for its repair or renewal . the present amounts , $ 10,000 and $ 30,000 respectively , will accordingly be raised to $ 12,000 and $ 37,000 .
the maximum daily rates payable by the employer for , respectively , hospital stay and out- patient treatment for an employee receiving medical treatment also require adjustment to take into account recent increases in the daily charges of government and subvented hospitals .
these rates have not been adjusted since 1977 and accordingly a rather higher level of increase is proposed , from $ 20 to $ 30 for each day of stay in a hospital and from $ 10 to $ 15 for each day of outpatient treatment .
the revised rates should enable an employee to recover full medical expenses from his employer if he receives treatment in a government or subvented hospital or to receive a reasonable subsidy if he chooses to receive treatment at private hospitals or from private doctors .
finally , section 11 ( 5 ) of the ordinance deems an employee &apos;s minimum earnings for the purpose of calculating compensation to be $ 600 .
this figure is based on the level of subsistence allowance for a single person under the public assistance scheme .
it is proposed to increase this figure to $ 800 in line with its current equivalent .
under section 48a of the employees &apos; compensation ordinance , levels of compensation may be amended by resolution of this council . an appropriate draft resolution has been prepared .
sir , i beg to move .
question put and agreed to .
pneumoconiosis ( compensation ) ordinance
the secretary for education and manpower moved the following motion : - that the ordinance be amended , with effect from 1 january 1986 , as follows - ( a ) in the first schedule - ( i ) in part i - ( a ) by deleting &apos; $ 242,000 &apos; in items 1,2 and 3 and substituting in each case the following - &apos; $ 299,000 &apos; ; and
the maximum and minimum levels of compensation specified in the pneumoconiosis ( compensation ) ordinance for death , total permanent incapacity and constant attention , and for daily rates of medical expenses , are the same as those under the employees &apos; compensation ordinance . it is therefore proposed that they be increased in line with the equivalent levels in the employees &apos; compensation ordinance , as provided in the resolution which i have just moved .
a resolution of the legislative council has been prepared under section 40 of the pneumoconiosis ( compensation ) ordinance which makes the proposed adjustments .
sir , i beg to move .
question put and agreed to .
first reading of bills
arbitration ( amendment ) ( no.2 ) bill 1985
bills read the first time and ordered to be set down for second reading pursuant to standing order 41 ( 3 ) .
second reading of bills
arbitration ( amendment ) ( no.2 ) bill 1985
the attorney general moved the second reading of : - &apos; a bill to amend the arbitration ordinance &apos; .
he said : - sir , i move that the arbitration ( amendment ) ( no.2 ) bill 1985 be read the second time .
the bill contains a short amendment to subsection ( 2 ) of section 6b of the arbitration ordinance to remove a potential difficulty .
section 6b empowers the high court to consolidate two or more arbitration proceedings on any of the grounds specified in subsection ( 1 ) .
the difficulty with the section is that where the court is required to appoint an arbitrator or umpire for consolidated arbitration proceedings , the existing provision does not expressly give the court power to remove any arbitrator or umpire already appointed to act in the various arbitration proceedings which the court wishes to consolidate .
this very problem arose in a recent high court case .
although it was held that the court did have the power to remove an existing arbitrator , it had to imply that power from a liberal reading of the section in the absence of express provision to that effect .
as a consequence , the judiciary has proposed that the section be amended to put beyond doubt that the court &apos;s power under section 6b ( 2 ) of the arbitration ordinance to appoint an arbitrator or umpire for consolidated proceedings includes the power to remove any existing arbitrator or umpire . hence this bill .
sir , i move the debate on this bill be now adjourned .
motion made . that the debate on the second reading of the bill be adjourned - the attorney general . question put and agreed to .

question proposed .
mr. cheng hon-kwan : - sir , an ad hoc group , with my colleague mr. peter c. wong as the convener , was formed to study the bill .
the group had the pleasure of meeting the secretary for lands and works and his colleagues in the administration on 5 november to clarify two points of concern .
the first relates to clause 3 in the bill , which seeks to validate retrospectively the delegations previously made to officers outside the building development department .
the group , which was concerned about the effect the clause might have on cases due to be heard in court , was assured at the meeting that there was no pending litigation .
the group accepts that the retrospective provision is necessary to put beyond doubt the building authority &apos;s power to recover costs of works which have been carried out by , for example. the engineering development department , on behalf of private developers .
the group &apos;s second - and in a way more serious - concern is about the wide power of delegation sought in the bill , whereby the director of building development , if the bill is enacted as it is , will be able to delegate his powers and functions to any government officers in any government departments .
the group takes the view that the scope of delegation should not be wider than necessary .
on the understanding that currently delegations have to be made to officers in only four departments , namely , building development department engineering development department , new territories development depart ment and lands department , it is considered that these departments should be specified in the legislation .
the group recognises. however. the need for flexibility .
in order that the scope of delegation may be extended , if and when necessary in future , without going through the elaborate procedure involved in amending an ordinance , the group has proposed that the specification be in the form of a schedule to the buildings ordinance and that the schedule may be revised by resolution of the council .
at the committee stage , my colleague , mr. ho sai-chu , will move an amendment to the bill to reflect the group &apos;s proposal .
sir , subject to that amendment , i support the motion .
i agree , therefore , that the delegation should be so specified .
question put and agreed to .

unofficial members &apos; motion
appointment of a select committee
miss lydia dunn moved the following motion : - that a select committee be appointed to examine the report by the select committee tabled in the legislative council on 7 august 1985 and to consider further and report on the appropriate measures to be taken to resolve the problems involved in the prosecution and trial of complex commercial crimes , including changes in the procedures before and during trial and the mode of trial .
she said : - sir , i rise to move the motion standing in my name on the order paper .
a select committee was appointed on 1 may 1985 by the council to consider and report on the appropriate measures to be taken to resolve the problems mvolved in the prosecution and trial of complex commercial crimes , including changes in the procedures before and during trial and the mode of trial .
however under standing order 61 ( 5 ) a select committee is automatically dissolved at the end of each session and by the time members were nominated on 25 may , this committee had only some two months to tackle a very important and complex task .
under the chairmanship of my colleague , mr. peter c. wong and with 13 of my unofficial colleagues plus mr. piers jacobs , the secretary for economic services as members , the committee sat nine times and met twice with the legal department , once with the commercial crime bureau of the royal hong kong police force and once in joint public session with the hong kong bar association and the law society of hong kong .
the present motion arises from a recommendation by the select committee in paragraph 17 of its report which was tabled in this council on 7 august 1985 .
the committee recommended that a select committee be appointed in the new session of the legislative council to consider further the appropriate measures to be taken to resolve the problems involved in the prosecution and trial of complex commercial crimes .
it said that a study of the fraud trials ( roskill ) committee report when it is published in the uk will be helpful , but any recommendations by that committee will need to be examined in the context of hong kong .
sir , i believe that although the committee reached no final conclusion , its preliminary enquiries were both encouraging and productive and will serve as a useful starting point for the new select committee .
sir , i beg to move .
the chief secretary : - sir , i rise to support miss dunn &apos;s motion and to assure her and her colleagues of the government &apos;s intention to do all it can to assist the select committee in its deliberations .
the select committee appointed in the last session under the chairmanship of mr. peter c. wong has already done much valuable work in identifying the problems involved in the investigation and prosecution of complex commercial crimes . i am sure that the new committee will continue this excellent work .
i take this opportunity of thanking mr. peter c. wong and the other members of the select committee appointed on 1 may 1985 for their dedicated efforts to find solutions to this problem .
question put and agreed to .
adjournment and next sitting .
his excellency the president : - in accordance with standing orders i now adjourn the council until 2.30 p.m. on 27 november 1985 .
adjourned accordingly at 4 o &apos;clock .
written answers
annex i
written answer by the secretary for education and manpower to mr. chung pui-lam &apos;s supplementary question to question no.2.
in accordance with regulation 56 ( 1 ) of the construction sites ( safety ) regulations , contractors are required to notify the labour department , in writing , within seven days of the commencement of work on site .
on receipt of the notification , the site will be visited by a member of the factory inspectorate and this initial visit will be followed by further inspections on a regular basis thereafter .
in the event that a contractor fails to notify the department of the commencement of work , then action will be taken in response to information from any other source indicating that construction work is under way .
failure to notify under section 56 ( 1 ) is an offence , the penalty for which is a fine of $ 10,000 .
at present the factory inspectorate has a strength of 188 inspectors and 31 of these are specifically assigned to this task . this enables the department to make three or four visits each year to active sites .
of course , sites which have an unfavourable safety record are subject to closer surveillance and more frequent visits .
annex ii
written answer by secretary for education and manpower to prof. poon &apos;s supplementary question to question no.7.
as a general rule we feel that children attending special schools should not have to pay more for transport than those attending ordinary schools .
at present special schools receive a transport subsidy in the form of a full subvention for meeting the salary of drivers providing transport services to schools for the blind , physically handicapped , the moderately and severely handicapped , the deaf ( primary ) and the maladjusted .
however there is some evidence to suggest that the average transport fees to users of special school transport are higher than ordinary school transport . the education department is therefore considering a proposal which would bring the special school transport fees into line with ordinary school transport fees .
i would hope that a government view can be taken on this proposal by mid-1986 .
written answers - continued
annex iii written answer by secretary for health and welfare to dr. conrad lam &apos;s supplementary question to question no.11.
statistics on the number of child abuse cases recorded by both the social welfare department and the voluntary agencies in late 1983 show that at that time there were 373 active cases . the figures at the end of 1984 and 1985 were 313 and 337 respectively .
while these statistics appear to confirm my belief that there are more cases of child abuse , the bases on which the two sets of statistics were complied were very different , and i doubt whether too much significance should be attached to the comparison .
however , i understand that social workers in the department feel that of the two problems that presented by child abuse is of greater concern .
in view of the increasing concern in the community about the problem of abuse of the elderly , it is clearly desirable that reliable statistics on these cases should be available .
as from 1 january 1986 , case-workers in the family service centres have been asked to examine their existing cases with a view to identifying those which involve abuse of the elderly. and to submit monthly returns to the headquarters .
based on these statistics , we should in due course be in a better position to assess the size of the problem and to establish trends .

the clerk to the legislative council mr. li wing
government business motion the chief secretary moved the following motion : - that this council thanks the governor for his address .
miss dunn : - sir , i support this motion of thanks to your excellency for a thorough and wide ranging statement of the government &apos;s plans and policies for the year ahead .
it provides us all with a wealth of material for this annual &apos; cross country &apos; debate . hong kong &apos;s newly constituted legislative council is given its first opportunity to show its mettle as an informed and effective scrutineer of the government &apos;s prospectus .
the unofficials have , as we have already announced , divided into five groups to study various parts of your address , sir . the areas on which the groups have concentrated are :
* the structure and machinery of government , the implementation of the joint declaration and the future of the public service , * economic and financial affairs ,
* social programmes ,
* development of the infrastructure ,
* law , order and security .
members speaking after me will speak in these groups . 22 members will speak today on government structure , the joint declaration , the public service , the economy and finance , law and order and security ; 23 members will speak tomorrow on social programmes and infrastructure .
so we shall , i hope , concentrate our fire on targets sighted in succession . this will be an improvement on the old &apos; scattered shots &apos; approach .
our speeches will be short - about ten minutes each is the limit we have set ourselves or you would be here all night . this means that none of us will be able to say everything we should like to say . so we wish to make it clear that the selectivity in our choice of subjects does not mean that we are not interested in the subjects that we shall leave to others .
in thanking you for your address , sir , i wish first to welcome your emphasis on the government &apos;s determination to continue its steady progress in all its practical programmes to ensure hong kong &apos;s continuing stability and prosperity .
china and britain have made it clear , not only in the wording of the joint declaration but also by the participation of the leaders of both countries in reaching this accord , that they earnestly desire the continued prosperity and stability of hong kong .
the will to observe the joint declaration is as strong as ever .
since the signing of the accord china &apos;s presence in hong kong has become more pronounced as has the hong kong presence in china .
neither is sinister .
the joint declaration is bound to result in much closer relations than have been seen in the past .
these are essential for the fulfilment of the vision that led to the joint declaration in the first place .
it is right that we should have an eye to the future but we must not let it dominate our thoughts to the exclusion of the more pedestrian problems of the present .
if we do not make the present work we shall not have a future .
so , i wish to suggest three areas of priority concern for our work in this session .
the first concerns the management of council business .
the standing orders of this council were rewritten in 1968 and they have been amended from time to time since .
we believe that they again need to be brought up to date .
we need to review our use of the standing orders in practice to enable us to despatch expeditiously the much expanded business of a council whose character and composition are very different from those of the 60s .
we suggest , therefore , that a select committee should be set up to review and revise the standing orders .
in addition , in order to develop greater accountability , we foresee a need to appoint more select committees with power to call for papers , to question witnesses and to conduct hearings publicly and privately .
this will require reinforcement of the clerk &apos;s office , just as we have already reinforced the secretariat of the unofficial members .
my next priority is the economy .
we must continue to fight protectionism in our principal markets .
our prosperity depends on our trade , and our trade depends on our access to markets .
without access our economy cannot thrive and without a thriving economy we cannot maintain our essential stability and prosperity .
for years now we have had to cope with steadily increasing restrictions on our access to markets .
we were often able to overcome these by switching products and markets .
to a large extent our success has masked the fact that the screw was being tightened all the time .
each renewal of the multi-fibre arrangement has moved the world trade in garments and textiles further and further away from the long term aim of liberalising trade .
the bilateral agreements that we have been obliged to accept have become more and more restrictive instead of less .
the government &apos;s overseas offices have given the impression that they have been able to do little more than react to each successive blow .
there are competent people in these offices but they have been kept so busy with their day to day work and so understaffed that they have not been able to anticipate protectionist attacks .
so i ask what is our overseas strategy ?
is it just to react ?
if we are to succeed in influencing events , surely we must anticipate , not just react .
what are we doing now to prepare the ground for the difficult negotiations required before the future of the multi-fibre arrangement comes under formal review next year ?
it may seem that the task of influencing opinion in our markets is so enormous that massive public relations campaigns costing millions are needed .
but this is not so .
the number of people involved in the vital decisions is quite small .
those people should be our targets and it will not cost millions to get at them .
we need to step up sharply our efforts to keep abreast of political , social and economic developments in our principal markets in order to be able to convince those who make the decisions of the merits of recognising and respecting our gatt rights .
we have recently reinforced our efforts in the united states , but it is very late in the day to expect even three lobbyists - where only a year ago we have none - to make any great impact .
our standing in the battle for understanding will be much strengthened when our long term status in the gatt is settled . this should be put beyond doubt as soon as possible .
although the objective is already guaranteed in annex i to the joint declaration , the matter is , as you tell us , sir , still under discussion in the joinst liaison group .
the discussions in the joint liaison group are only a beginning .
after they are complete it will still be necessary to secure formal gatt acceptance of , and recognition for , whatever it is that britain and china agree on .
i hope this important matter will be settled definitively very soon .
my third priority concerns hong kong &apos;s international reputation .
many years ago we had a not entirely undeserved reputation for producing cheap and shoddy goods . the reputation persisted long after the products had been upgraded .
now we are getting a reputation for expensive and shoddy financial transactions .
such a reputation is easier to acquire than to get rid of .
you have referred , sir , to the need to improve the legal and institutional framework in which the financial and allied service industries operate ; and to the need for improvements in the companies and securities ordinances .
we all know how complex these matters are but we need to be seen to be doing our best to put our house in order as a matter of urgency .
we cannot expect reputable people to invest here unless they can have confidence in our regulatory systems .
we do not want to be seen as a place that attracts only those who are out to make a fast - and crooked - buck ; or to be branded as a tax haven , or as a laundry for dirty money .
you have told us , sir , of the welcome reinforcement of the commercial crime bureau and of the service offered by the corruption prevention advisory services group - a service which you say has been &apos; drawn to the attention of government-listed contractors and subvented organisations &apos; .
surely such services should be marketed much more widely than that .
nobody likes to admit corruption in his own organisation . he does not feel the need for these services .
it is a major task to convince managers that even if they have no corruption in their own organisation they should still look at their procedures to see if they can be improved .
these services should not only be available to every firm in business but every firm in business should know about them .
the growth in commercial crime and in private sector corruption reports spells danger to everyone in the business and , if not checked , for the whole of our society .
it is not enough for the honest businessman to keep his own nose clean . he must play his part in preventing fraud and helping to catch the crooks .
it is important that our own tax system should not provide new and unnecessary opportunities or incentives to break the law .
we must keep it simple and efficient .
complicated tax laws are unlikely to enhance the revenue by much . they are far more likely to drive new investment away and to breed complicated schemes for tax avoidance and evasion among those who remain .
in august 1985 reuters quoted a u.s. treasury report that more than 3 000 u.s. millionaires paid virtually no federal income tax in the previous year while nearly 30 000 people with annual incomes of over a quarter of a million u.s. dollars paid less than five per cent of it in income taxes .
what a tribute to the skills of a good tax lawyer !
do we really want to encourage the members of that fundamentally unproductive profession to come forth and multiple here in hong kong ? so much for the three areas of priority in which we have much more work to do .
in carrying out this work i should like to assure you , sir , and the people of hong kong that we , the members of this council , are all determined to work together for the good of hong kong .
we shall have our disagreements .
we are , after all , 46 individuals . we shall make our own judgements . in doing so we shall all do our best to put any particular interests we represent in the context of the general interest of the community .
the people of hong kong , to whom we are responsible , are not doctrinaire they are practical people . they view politics with the greatest scepticism . they will be looking for results and they will judge us by results .
we must understand what it is that people want . we must reflect this in our own policy proposals , and in our study of government proposals . but the government must take heed of what we say - not just succumb to our votes .
the power of a vote in the council is the power of a sledge-hammer . a vote against the government is a negative exercise of power .
our numbers enable us to prevent new laws being passed , to prevent new taxes being raised , to prevent revenue being spent . but this sledge-hammer power is not suitable for cracking nuts . and most of the business of this council is concerned with cracking nuts. some large , some quite small .
the government has , therefore , a part to play too .
the policies that the government brings forward to this council must be policies that we can support .
this means that policy proposals must be backed up with full information and justification . this is much more likely to be the case if they have been developed in co- operation between the civil service and the unofficials rather than hatched in secret and launched at this council without warning .
the government must also be prepared to argue its case , not just to assert it .
if it cannot convince us by reason and research , it must be prepared to think again .
we on our part must be equally prepared publicly to support those policies which we have developed in cooperation with the civil service .
we must always be prepared to support the government when it is right , to question it when we are not convinced and to oppose it when we believe it is wrong .
it is only in this way that we shall be able , in your own words last year , sir - &apos; to develop a system of government which is firmly rooted in our community , in which the views of the community are fully represented and which is more directly accountable to the people of hong kong . &apos;
dr. ho : - sir , as i see it , the tone of your annual address gave strong indications that the hong kong government is determined to implement the twin goals of prosperity and stability enshrined in the sino-british joint declaration and to steer the territory through a smooth transition to the special administrative region status .
the long list of infrastructure and urban renewal projects , as outlined , will serve to boost confidence in local and overseas investors and concurrently to demonstrate the government &apos;s commitment to sustain hong kong &apos;s long term development .
for these reasons , sir , your annual address was warmly received in general .
i. district administration consultation is a fundamental element in the policy-making process in our government machinery .
at the district level , the public attempt to influence government decisions by channelling their views and wishes through their district board members , elected and appointed .
in recent months , we saw important government policy proposals heatedly debated in district boards .
prior to these debates , district board members have to spend a great deal of time and attention in consulting and canvassing their constituencies .
therefore , an uninhibited dialogue must be built between them .
to promote this free-flow communication , district board members have been making repeated requests to the central government for assistance in the form of subsidised office accommodation and secretarial services .
i urge that the government promptly consider their requests .
ii . british national ( overseas ) passports the white paper on the draft hong kong ( british nationality ) order 1986 , published over a month ago , has drawn considerable comments from the public .
not only does it spell out the necessary amendments which have to be made to a number of related pieces of legislation in the united kingdom regarding the provision of a new british status for the hong kong british dependent territories citizens after 30 june 1997 , it also demonstrates her majesty &apos;s government &apos;s commitment to the faithful implementation of the sino-british joint declaration .
sir , this important document merits in-depth examination and i am pleased to learn that an opportunity has been arranged for members of this council to debate it on 4 december 1985 .
leaving the technical aspects of the british national ( overseas ) passports to the scheduled debate , i would , nevertheless , like to raise a point of practical significance this afternoon .
to the travelling public who are eligible for the new british status , they have yet to be convinced that the new british national ( overseas ) passport could afford the same degree of , if not more , convenience and benefit of travel as the alternative british dependent territories citizen passport which they would still be entitled to between now and 30 june 1997 .
much has been said as regards why the government wants to issue the passport well in advance , but it is equally important , from the &apos; user &apos; point of view , that the advantages to holders of the new passport be clearly explained .
i fully endorse the wish of the government to have the british national ( overseas ) passport well tested in the run-up to 1997 , but i would also urge the government to perfect the &apos; marketing &apos; of this brand-new untested product so as to encourage those eligible to take it up .
iii . organised crime turning to my last topic , i wish to reflect some observations which i have made on law and order .
there is considerable amount of legislation enacted to counter organised criminal activities , but unfortunately these laws are either inadequately applied or not fully exploited .
the public widely hold the view that the penalty imposed on convicted offenders is too lenient to produce a deterrent effect .
according to police statistics on triad society members arrested for committing various offences in 1983 , custodial sentences were meted out to 17 per cent of the offenders convicted of unlawful society offences , to 26 per cent of serious assaults , to 33 per cent of gang fights and to 57 per cent of blackmail .
in police prosecution , it is found extremely difficult to obtain a conviction of triad membership .
even if convicted , the current tariff is light , especially for youthful offenders .
men in the street would also like to see that the court , in appropriate circumstances , make more frequent use of section 21 of the immigration ordinance ( chapter 115 ) which provides for a deportation order for certain offences . this order will certainly help to suppress crime rates .
i wish to point out that in the latter part of 1950s , the police successfully disintegrated triad societies by recourse to the special legislation , &apos; the emergency ( detention orders ) regulations 1956 &apos; .
over 10 000 triad officials and members were arrested and over 400 of the top officials were deported .
many surrendered themselves for being placed on supervision orders in preference to detention and deportation .
i have no intention to interfere with the independence of the judiciary .
but i am merely voicing the views and wishes of the general public that members of the judiciary would duly reflect public sentiments and the gravity of the crime in their administration of criminal justice .
the real deterrent to a criminal is his being caught and penalised severely .
it has been suggested that more investigatory powers be given to police officers , in order to enable them to gain access to certain information concerning those engaged in serious crimes .
in addition , more stringent laws such as those on criminal conspiracy , on consorting , and on forfeiture of ill-gotten gains from illicit activities , may be enacted .
the protagonists of civic rights may be critical of these new powers and laws . however , i appeal to them that they must weigh the sacrifice of some individual freedom against the effects these legislative measures may have in contributing to an improved social order .
at times of deteriorating social order , draconian laws must prevail .
as knowledge will lead to understanding and hence to support , i suggest that the government make an effort to properly and adequately inform all sectors of the community of the full extent of organised crime and its overall anti-triad strategies , in particular , those parts where public participation and cooperation are to be enlisted .
the publicity and education work undertaken in the fields of narcotics and corruption is very successful , and the same approach can be applied in the war against syndicated crime .
if the fears of human liberties being unduly eroded are still high in spite of all publicity efforts , i suggest that these new statutes might be enacted with a life of , say , five years .
when law and order returns , these statutes will not be extended to a further period .
this practice is not new , as certain sections of the immigration ordinance ( chapter 115 ) and of the merchant shipping ordinance ( chapter 281 ) to provide measures in connection with illegal immigrants and vietnamese refugees were enacted with a specified period of life , to be extended in the light of new circumstances .
with these remarks , sir , i support the motion .
mr. chan kam-chuen : - sir , on 30 october 1985 , we rejoiced in having a newly decorated home which we could call our own .
the occasion was also significant in that we had newly elected members joining the legislature for the first time in the history of hong kong .
he is a man whom one met quite often in business circles and in government advisory board meetings and he had worked faithfully in an industrial organsiation for 16 years .
his service is now terminated and he faces an uncertain future .
house rules versus the law of the land the important issue is whether house rules are above the law of the land .
the allegation of interfering in an organisation &apos;s internal affairs and the right of an employer to set down conditions of employment are all irrelevant when it conflicts with the spirit of the law and against the common good .
should employers now move that all their paid staff be banned from taking part in jury service and concentrate full time on their employment ?
the same ban may be applied to participation in military service , then countries like switzerland would have no army for defence overnight .
this man was sentenced by his employer to deprivation of election rights for the term of his working life .
the public spirit the public spirit of upholding the law and supporting the government would become mere lip service if this precedent is perpetuated .
fortunately there are still a lot of employers with public spirit and who care for the good image of their organisations. otherwise most of the working class legislators would disappear from this council .
in fact , one can always work flexi-hours to do both jobs by pre-planning one &apos;s time and office work with some encouragement from one &apos;s employer .
the splitting of society into well-to-do employers with political rights and the &apos; untouchable &apos; employees without political rights would cause unrest .
i hope that this is the only exception and anti-victimisation measures similar to those in the employment ordinance should be considered to prevent recurrence .
if this is the &apos; hong kong people ruling hong kong &apos; pattern , then this issue sends a chill down my spine .
the economy our exports have dropped , partly due to world economy and we must maintain our hk $ 7.80 to the us $ 1 rate for our exports to remain competitive .
we must keep a watchful eye on rising unemployment figures .
hong kong prides herself with tripartite solutions to labour problems and when good employers contribute their money and labour contribute their efforts , i recommend that government should contribute their services , gratis , to alleviate workers &apos; hardship .
then those long white banners outside their offices and policemen inside their offices to rescue the negotiators will be a thing of the past .
our re-export figures have increased but as the goods are not manufactured here , the labour cost content is limited to transportation and associated services .
fortunately , for hong kong consumers , parallel goods , especially foodstuff , have helped to keep prices down .
the property market gave us confusing news .
for three consecutive days , three pieces of choice properties could not be sold at the upset prices and had to be withdrawn .
but auctions which follow yield different results .
the internal consumer markets , such as restaurants , jewellery , fashions etc. are sluggish due to the disappearance of their richer and long standing clients who are on prolonged holidays overseas .
confidence it is therefore important that politicians should be specific and careful with their public statements to enhance confidence , otherwise it would plummet like the share index and does no one any good , except for those who sold short beforehand .
i pray that all parties concerned should put stability and prosperity at the top of their priority list .
with these observations , sir , i support the motion .
mr. stephen cheong : - sir , since the initialling of the sino-british joint declaration in september 1984 , there has been quite visible signs of an upturn in our real estate and stock markets .
these have been hailed repeatedly as signs of substantial restoration of confidence in hong kong &apos;s future .
the signing of the joint declaration may be one thing , the successful implementation of all its provisions is quite another .
the next few years will be very very crucial .
on both the political and economic fronts we are at a cross road .
i had planned to address my observations to both important subject areas this afternoon , but , this will certainly take me over the agreed guideline of ten minutes .
perhaps , my colleagues will be glad to lean that i intend to honour the guideline and therefore confine myself to only one subject matter .
politically , we need to find and develop an institutional framework which will have the best prospects of surviving the progression towards the ultimate implementation of the joint declaration .
this is no easy task , for that structure has to be seen to be able to achieve a smooth transition to the arrangements envisaged for 1997 , while at the same time provide a meaningful base for fostering our future stability and prosperity .
patience , understanding and sincere co-operation from all sides are crucial if we are to achieve these objectives .
it may be inherent in international diplomacy that one side should have little trust of the other , and it is sad that the case of hong kong is no exception despite the fact that both britain and china have so openly and repeatedly declared their common objectives for hong kong , the level of mistrust mutually between the two sides still appears to be high .
china still seems to be very skeptical of any proposals raised by britain , understandably so on the side of caution , but it cannot be denied also that such caution , when carried too far would impede proper and objective analysis of issues , thus unnecessarily causing serious problems to be deferred rather than solved .
britain , on the other hand , seems to have taken a somewhat nonchalant attitude and initially has done little to remove that mistrust .
certain proposals might have been put forward in all sincerity , but when setbacks were encountered , there seems to have been lacking a sense of dynamism in pursuing a satisfactory solution for hong kong .
it is so easy to fall into the trap of thinking that &apos; the other side will never understand so what more can one do ? &apos;
surely , if both sides were to make no positive adjustments to this respective frames of mind in the next few years , it is difficult to see how the common objective can be achieved smoothly .
i would therefore urge both parties to interact with sympathy , understanding and due consideration for our anxieties , and to work closely and pragmatically towards developing solutions that could manifestly foster and maintain public confidence .
as for the people of hong kong , whatever our private feelings may be , we have to recognise and come to terms with the fact that the source of power of the future s.a.r. government will be derived from the central government of china .
the deep concern of the majority of our populace is over possible future changes in china and not over whether or not china will accept a system of direct elections .
we feel lost and uncertain because we are afraid that china will deviate significantly from its present course of policies and not over whether or not our future legislature will be mainly directly elected .
one thing in fact is very clear and we must not harbour any illusions over it . a high degree of autonomy for the s.a.r. government is not synonymous with independence , nor with the freedom of action one normally associates with democratic government based on universal suffrage .
the future s.a.r. government will always walk a tight rope , and it will constantly have to reconcile the interests of the people of hong kong with the interest of the central government of china .
not to accept this reality i submit is plain stupidity .
indeed if we are to achieve prosperity and stability , within this kind of autonomous environment , it behoves us to maintain our economic progress as our top priority , if only because making money is a field of endeavour we are good at , whilst progress on other idealistic fronts should be pursued patiently and step by step .
as of late , it seems to me that there has been undue haste on the part of certain groups of people to force onto the community a future form of government long before the legislature has had a chance to review , in 1987 , its present structure .
the high degree of excitement coupled with the call for directly elected representatives accompanying the proposed formation of the basic law consultative committee seems to be part of that undue haste .
it has been claimed that the process of democratisation in hong kong cannot be stopped and that , prior to 1997 , there must be in place a totally or at least 50 per cent directly elected legislature .
it has even been postulated that a democratic s.a.r. government created through direct elections is the only desirable means of structure that will be able to withstand adverse effects and pressure arising from possible excesses in china .
in further support for the push for direct elections , some people consider that the recent electoral college form of election should be replaced by direct elections .
with your permission , sir , i wish to place on record the fact that i am not a diehard opponent to direct elections as some may believe .
i do have an open mind on this issue .
i would even go so far as to postulate that as the political experience of our society progresses , it may be desirable to have an element or elements of direct , territory-wide , single-list type elections within our future constitutional framework .
i am also in the firm belief that in the context of hong kong &apos;s unique situation , we should examine the merits or demerits of direct elections with a pragmatic and realistic attitude taking into account fully the avowed common objective of stability and prosperity whilst avoiding the idealogical and emotional slant of any analysis .
furthermore , before we can come down on to any firm decisions , i believe we should first re-examine the rationale behind starting our constitutional development route with indirect elections .
we have to consider whether it has achieved the desired objective of returning the sort of candidates with the right sort of calibre to take up the job as a legislative councillor .
if there are problems with indirect elections , we should consider whether we can solve these problems and to improve on the system .
what is the real rationale of dumping the indirect election system without giving it a fair examination ?
save for ideological beliefs , i must confess i fail to see any pragmatic reason why hong kong needs to be that impatient to establish beyond any doubt the desirability of direct elections .
sir , even if we eventually conclude that there is a case for some sort of trials in direct elections in the future , we still have to face the fact that hong kong is not and will not become an independent sovereign state .
we survived and thrived economically without having to undertake political experimentation .
let us not now prematurely introduce drastic changes to our formula for success .
like it or not , we owe our existence now and in future to our continued economic successes .
we do not have the luxury to err .
if ever our prosperity is threatened through our own impatience , we would not be able to achieve the twin objective of developing for the future s.a.r. government a political structure that would be respected by both the people of hong kong and by the central government of china , and one that would be manifestly capable of fostering hong kong &apos;s status as stable and prosperous international business and financial centre .
sir , i would like to conclude with a plea to the hong kong media .
i plead that our friends in the media should consider re-examining whether or not they have over allocated resources to cover the overheated political scene .
i was told that , during a recent hour-long briefing session with the press by the chief secretary , 75 per cent of all questions asked were of a political nature , focussing on issues which may well be premature for any responsible public figure to commit or even to comment one way or the other .
memories of similar experiences encountered by many of my honourable unofficial colleagues must be equally vivid .
in my view such intense political heat and speculative questioning is not conducive for hong kong to find the much needed balanced answers to so many sensitive and thorny issues the solution of which will be critical to our future well being .
i can fully understand politics is more liable to breed controversies which make interesting or even exciting reading .
yet , hong kong does have other important issues which may be equally interesting to readers . for example , the future of the multi-fibre arrangement , hong kong &apos;s role in negotiating an extension of the gatt to cover world trade in services , and the development of our transportation and industrial support infrastructure , to name only a few .
even the intelligentsia of hong kong do not need excitements everyday and it may even be useful and constructive for the community to have some cooling periods now and again .
afterall , how many of us are really that brilliant as to be able to think clearly and rationally in a continuous atmosphere of tension and over excitement .
we must not run the risks of placing the priorities of hong kong out of perspective and in this respect .
sir , may i echo full support to the theme of our honourable senior colleague miss lydia dunn .
there will be no future for us if we do not address and resolve the problems of here and now .
and the issues of today which impinge on the future stability and prosperity of hong kong are precisely what those two words imply .
it is not without good political sense that someone once said : &apos; take care of the pennies and the pounds will take care of themselves . &apos;
let us all reflect , ponder , react and work steadily towards continued progress in our quest for hong kong &apos;s stability and prosperity now and in the years to come .
mr. cheung yan-lung : - sir , you have demonstrated in your address this year a commitment of the government to maintain the prosperity and stability of hong kong and to flexibly and extensively consult and liaise with the people of hong kong at various levels .
the government is also sparing no effort to improve our social and economic systems and to provide the infrastructure which will sustain continuous development .
sir , i welcome these as they will ensure growth and strengthen our confidence in our future .
sir , you have also pointed out the need for a more representative government .
towards these objectives , the regional council , when established next year , will have directly elected members , members elected by district boards , appointed members and ex-officio members from heung yee kuk , representating a wide cross-section of the interests of the region .
the regional council will also elect its representative to this council .
these will ensure a close link for consultation among the three tiers of the government structure .
to complement these , the provisional regional council has also set up an unique committee system consisting of three functional select committees to formulate policies for municipal services . it also has nine district committees , chaired by the respective district board representatives in the council , to deal with operational matters .
i am confident , sir , that the regional council with its representative structure and consultative network through its committees , will function properly in developing municipal services in the region .
as regards the finance of the regional council , arrangements are being worked out with the financial secretary .
in this respect , i would like to stress that the regional council requires sufficient revenue to support its various activities .
as you said , sir , the main source of this revenue will be the rates collected in the regional council area ; and if the financial secretary considers it necessary to propose a small increase in the rates next year , the revenue so generated should be allocated to the regional council to enable it to fulfil its responsibilities .
however , rates alone are most unlikely to be sufficient to finance the 428 capital works projects costing a total of $ 4,013 million which is the council &apos;s responsibility .
to put the financial position of the regional council on a proper footing , i feel obliged , sir , to solicit an understanding on the part of the government to continue to share the heavy financial burden on capital works until the regional council is in a position to take it over itself , hopefully in a few years &apos; time .
while still on the matter of the regional council , i feel disappointed at the result of the recent registration for the urban council and regional council elections next year .
a net increase of only 20 000 voters is by no means a satisfactory figure .
the government does not seem to have promoted the registration with the same stamina as demonstrated in the recent district board and legislative council elections .
bearing in mind that the functioning of the representative government will be reviewed , i would suggest that we should not overlook the possibility of extending the franchise to those who have reached the age of 18 .
young people in hong kong mature at an age earlier than before .
at reaching this age , many of them have completed their secondary education and have joined the society as a work force . some continue to receive higher education in our post-secondary colleges and universities . they are a group whom we have provided with better education .
on their part they have demonstrated increasing social and political consciousness .
i think they deserve the entrustment of electoral rights .
my next topic concerns agriculture which is within the geographical area of the regional council but not directly connected with it .
any visitor to the new territories will marvel at the results of the rapid developments , the efficient rail and road systems and the spacious housing estates .
but how many appreciate the sacrifice new territories farmers have made in support of these developments ?
our agricultural community is a battered one .
our farmers have to struggle for a living against keen competition from incessant imports of agricultural products .
the younger generation seeks employment in industries and business which often offer better pay , resulting in a shortage of farm hands and large pieces of arable land being laid waste .
under the existing policy , the compensation they may receive depends on the location of the land that is being resumed .
only those whose land falls within development boundaries receive full compensation equivalent to the fair market value of the land ; those outside may only receive as low as one-fifth .
this is very unfair development layouts are zoned by the government in accordance with development needs . it is understandable from the government &apos;s point of view that land lying within a development area is more valuable .
however , to a genuine farmer , a piece of arable land is of the same agricultural value regardless of its location in relation to the development .
being forced to give up their land is unfortunate , it is also unfair that they only receive a portion of the full compensation due to their land being unwittingly placed outside the area of development .
they suffer the same in being up-rooted and deprived of their means of livelihood , they do not have the skill nor assistance from the government to re- establish themselves in a new trade or occupation .
our agricultural community is not dying . it has a work force of 24 000 people , about one per cent of our economically active population . it has an annual output of agricultural products valued at $ 1,400 million . it has good potentials in that there is arable land which has not been utilised .
yet we have farmers displaced by resumption who are unable to re-establish themselves in farming .
sir , i am not only calling for a review of the compensation policy for land resumption . i wish to suggest that the government should establish a policy to encourage and support the cultivation of wasted arable land .
this could be achieved by resiting displaced farmers to fallow land leased by the government for this purpose , with rental subsidies given where necessary .
the government should at the same time extend its work in introducing new and improved production techniques and equipment supported by increased agricultural loans and marketing facilities in order to make farming economically viable .
as a result , the agricultural community may have the ability to improve its environment including the problem of agricultural pollution .
after all , the government has the responsibility to help the unemployed to seek jobs . we certainly owe more to these farmers who lose their land through no fault of theirs and we should do more to help by providing additional assistance .
this policy , if established and expanded , has the additional merit of taping our last valuable natural resources which otherwise would continue to lay waste .
we may also become less dependent on imported agricultural products .
sir , i hope my suggestion , in a rudimentary form though it may be , will be seriously considered by the government .
my last point today concerns consumer protection and quality control of our industrial products and commercial practices .
recently we have enacted legislation to regulate the activities of money-changers and to require the registration of travel agents .
the government and the consumer council are also considering legislative amendments which will enable the small claims tribunal to accord priority to complaints from tourists who are being ripped-off by dishonest traders .
these measures will go some way to deter the unscrupulous traders and help to prevent foreign tourists from being cheated in hong kong .
protection for the general consumer deserves equal concern .
we should speed up trade description and weights and measures legislation to ensure that the contents of the goods in our shops are accurately described and that we get the quantity of high quality goods we pay for .
by promoting these , it will not only contribute towards preserving the prestige of hong kong as a shoppers &apos; paradise but will also help to instil overseas confidence in the quality of our products .
these will definitely help to further develop and maintain the prosperity and stability of hong kong .
sir , with these remarks , i support the motion .
mrs. chow : - sir , paragraph 3 of article i of annex i of the sino-british joint declaration states the key elements of the hong kong special administrative region government .
firstly , the government and legislature of the hong kong special administrative region shall be composed of local inhibitants .
secondly , the chief executive of the hong kong special administrative region shall be selected by election or through consultation held locally and be appointed by the central people &apos;s government .
thirdly , principal officers ( equivalent to secretaries ) shall be nominated by the chief executive of the hong kong special administrative region and appointed by the central people &apos;s government .
