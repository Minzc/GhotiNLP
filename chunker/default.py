"""

You have to write the perc_train function that trains the feature weights using the perceptron algorithm for the CoNLL 2000 chunking task.

Each element of train_data is a (labeled_list, feat_list) pair. 

Inside the perceptron training loop:

    - Call perc_test to get the tagging based on the current feat_vec and compare it with the true output from the labeled_list

    - If the output is incorrect then we have to update feat_vec (the weight vector)

    - In the notation used in the paper we have w = w_0, w_1, ..., w_n corresponding to \phi_0(x,y), \phi_1(x,y), ..., \phi_n(x,y)

    - Instead of indexing each feature with an integer we index each feature using a string we called feature_id

    - The feature_id is constructed using the elements of feat_list (which correspond to x above) combined with the output tag (which correspond to y above)

    - The function perc_test shows how the feature_id is constructed for each word in the input, including the bigram feature "B:" which is a special case

    - feat_vec[feature_id] is the weight associated with feature_id

    - This dictionary lookup lets us implement a sparse vector dot product where any feature_id not used in a particular example does not participate in the dot product

    - To save space and time make sure you do not store zero values in the feat_vec dictionary which can happen if \phi(x_i,y_i) - \phi(x_i,y_{perc_test}) results in a zero value

    - If you are going word by word to check if the predicted tag is equal to the true tag, there is a corner case where the bigram 'T_{i-1} T_i' is incorrect even though T_i is correct.
