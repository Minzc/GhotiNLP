* segment.py is the Python implementation of the pseudocode provided by Anoop. It is so slow that it never generates an output.

* segment1.py is the improved version. I made the following changes:
    * I didn't use heap
    * Iterate i through the chart, and update the following charts
  
  so the overall complexity is O(N), and I got the accuracy 80.44
